The Constitution</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Australia, being a federation, is different to Britain which has no state
governments to have powers in conflict with the lower House. The House of
Commons exercises final authority in the UK, not being subject to the Queen or
the House of Lords. Thus the Queen has only a formal role in relation to the
parliament. </p>

<p>Formed one hundred years ago, the Constitution reflects the powers of the
monarchy at that time, when the Crown had real power. The draconian powers of
the Queen in our written constitution must obviously be deleted. </p>

<p>Under our Constitution, the Executive is the Executive Council, and as the
Queen's representative, the Governor-General presides over its formal meetings,
and with his signature turns bills passed by Parliament into Acts. His
decisions follow the recommendations of the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The Governor-General exercises a formal supervision over the delicate
balance between the States house (the Senate) and the House of Representatives
- i.e. the balance achieved by the Senate's restraining powers over the
government in the Lower House - to protect the smaller states from
disadvantage, and the Federation from secession and disintegration.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><i>A </i>Preamble to the Constitution
...2/4/99. </p>

<p>We, the people of Australia, having our origins in this and many other
lands, with diverse cultures, beliefs and abilities, but equal before God and
the law, hereby determine to live in harmony, mutual respect and concern for
each other, in our evolving democratic system of representative
self-government, within the framework of this Constitution as from time to time
amended by the people in a referendum. </p><P>
