		 <P>There is sharp debate between the relevant philosophies of  the  Left and Right on this subject.  
On the one side, fears  of exploitation by employers, compassion for the needs of weaker  workers, and faith in organisation and consensus.  On the  other side there is exasperation with a welfare-type wages system and  strikes and stoppages; but with a faith in individual  initiative and incentives for hard work, to give personal benefits and a competitive edge to the country's productive  capacity.
<P>To combine peace and productivity in the work force, these pressures need to find a balance which we would call justice - with, maybe, just a touch of mercy!
<P>To combine these two requires a Solomon? Maybe, but if at the end of a prolonged confrontation a solution is found, basically because it <I>must</I>, then it makes sense for that 'must' to be the function of an agency, operating on behalf of government, to find and apply. Why endure the public angst and loss while the  antagonists bloody their economic noses in heated, determined confrontation?
<p>It seems profoundly sensible for a community problem of conflict, like this,  to be able to be resolved by an independent authority with the unqualified backing of  a <i>people’s</i> government.
<p>Whatever is the matter with arbitration?</b>
<P>Why 'pussy-foot' around!
 The solution to industrial disputation requires positive, strong action by government. It requires <I>democratic</I> government action. But where is it???

  

<P>Now we hear that the security guards at Melbourne airport have the approval of the Industrial Relations Commission for their program of snap strikes - it is a legal right for them to do this in their clash with the airport owner. Where do the public stand in all this? Nowhere is  the inconvenience and loss of the public taken into account - an offence  against public justice for all!
<P> And a compromise <I>will </I>  be found, eventually, won't it?
<P>Why not find that now in the impartial wisdom of an arbitrator? Is that so impossible - if the arbitrator is impartially selected and appointed by impartial (democratic) government. Democratic? that's the rub - the real problem - to have government  with the goodwill and wisdom to  appoint an arbitrator with the  wisdom to hand down real decisions  which  will 'stick' because they are fair, and because the arbitrator has the  necessary authority from government.  
 <P> Party   governments  have never been able  to  achieve    success in the area of industrial relations. It  has  been truly said that, parliament,  because  of its partisan  nature,  is  not suited to interfere in   these matters.
<P>But now, instead of an Arbitration Commission and Arbitration Court, we have a 'Minister for Industrial Relations' - in a quite partisan government! We've gone backwards.
<P> Parliaments, such as we have, are inclined to be  either too  autocratic    or  too sympathetic in their   industrial    relations.      Consequently, either justice or appropriate authority  is likely to be
lacking, complicating the role of  arbitral   bodies,  and making them uncertain and  weak.
<P>    Conservatives tend to have faith in employers to do the right thing, and doubt the goodwill of workers and unions while, vice  versa, Labor tends to see the protection of workers as an   important
responsibility.    
<P>     A  common complaint by unions is that  government  does  not  meet  its  responsibilities  
toward   the   workers.   One  leader commented that, because  of the failure of   government   agencies, workplaces would be far  from safe without  union  action.
     
   
<P>    Government has failed in two ways - failed the workers in  not safeguarding their  legitimate concerns,  and failed the  people   at large  by  allowing  unions  to succeed with stand over  tactics.  
     The public   suffers   the   inconvenience, or worse, of the dislocation  of  services,  and  employers, and the economy, suffer the loss of production. These losses are never recovered.  The  dislocating   effects are felt far and wide,  through shortages and late  deliveries of materials and parts, with the resulting, and ongoing, need  to hold larger reserve stocks. Such effects, and the  possibility  of them, hobble industry, making it inefficient and causing it to  lose its 'get up and go'; which has a good deal to do, no  doubt,  with the present malaise in the economy.
  <P>   In many situations of possible conflict between two forces, there are some on either side who give good reason for the  other's fears. Fear and suspicion then make each side take a  jaundiced view of the other.                           
     <P>   Enterprise bargaining has considerably reduced the circumstances for employees in the less  profitable industries.    The more successful industries  can pay higher wages, while many industries could not. We have our share of blame. We, the public, have two hats or personalities - as consumers and as 'workers' (until retirement). We, as consumers  in  our  super stores, accept the lower prices caused by  the fierce competition in a these big  industries, while the 'giants'  are  'screwing' small suppliers on our behalf. The free market can be merciless. 
<P>   A free market  is  only justified  where there are many buyers, many  sellers.  The  growth  of the monopoly  giants in  all  categories  of the  system - big business, big (and  bigger) unions  -  defeats  the advantages, and the equity,  of the  'free  market'.  Free  market  forces are not an
acceptable form  of  control because  there  are virtually no longer  free markets.  The rich will  assuredly  get richer and the poor  will  just as certainly  get  poorer,  sowing   the   seeds of future  misery.
<P>    The Coalition  has  introduced individual contracts for workers with <I>some </I>present award conditions as minimums. 
 This has weakened  workers  against exploitation by some employers.  While competition is desirable, many individual workers and few employers  make very imperfect competition and workers acutely
vulnerable - and fearful. They can thus be pressured to accept contracts. Will renewable contracts have  downgraded conditions? Can workers give of their best in these, essentially slave like, conditions?  
<p>Globalisation has produced a sea change in industry, with the 'falling leaves' of factories relocated overseas. The tendency to one-sided free trade has increased the inflow of cheap goods which has helped government to keep inflation low! 'The economy is in good shape' we hear. Retail sales are up! (But what about ballooning credit-card debt?) The fallen dollar should be a big help to exporters but not all markets are in favour of free trade.
<p>Overseas competition is uncovering our deficiencies in a much tougher world than we have been used to. We badly need government which does not discourage, but can  rally our spirit to meet the vastly changing circumstances.

<P>    Mutual trust is needed. It is obvious that in countries with 
the best economic record all concerned pull together. Without  trust
that is not possible. But trust must have a basis.    
<P>    We need non-partisan government to establish a new regime of 
trust and cooperation. As long as the party system remains in our 
parliaments we will not be able to progress beyond the  confrontation of
the past. The waste of time, energy and morale  must go.   

<P>  Only  government which can stand against the pressures of vested interests, and has the confidence and wholehearted support of the people, can contribute justice and peace.  
<P>    That kind of government we do not have.    
<P>    If,  as we certainly claim, the  party  system  is indeed  the obstacle  to   genuine, efficient, responsive,  and   responsible   government,  then  its banishment  from   our   parliaments  offers  the
 real hope  for  the future in this area, as  in  all  others.
<P><B>Unions and Government.</B>
<P>Do we need unions??? If government was doing its job of governing FOR All the people we probably would see fairness prevailing through better community attitudes and government supervision where necessary. But we don't have that luxury.
<P>Unions exist primarily through the failures of government, and also the failures of others whose actions, of lack of them, governments should deal with but don't. Sometimes government raises the issue of the secret ballot in union meetings to enable union decisions to better reflect the views of union members.

<P> But it is manifestly incongruous to demand that unions accede to balloting of their decisions in meetings unless parliaments accept this as normal democratic practice for themselves. Obviously party governments are weak because they do not practise the internal ballot for <I>their </I> decisions, and that weakness precludes them from the embarrassment of pursuing the subject with regard to union meetings.

   <P><B>Voting in Unions</B>    
<p>  For a long time governments have been strangely quiet about enforcing secret ballots for union decisions which affect  the public. Many have commented on this apparent reluctance, as many a worrying dispute could have been settled  earlier with this provision. Peter Reith,  debating with Bob McMullen (Labor Shadow Minister)   on Radio National,   demurely defended inclusion of this provision  in government plans, as a 'democratic practice! Of course it is. But many have remarked that if it is good enough for the unions then there can be no excuse for excluding this so democratic practice from the operation of our parliaments. It has been well said, over the centuries,  that the more people involved in decisions the more satisfactory those decisions will be. And, in fact, decisions by parliament are <I>minority </I> decisions - no doubt about it.


							  <P> Much has
been said about the desirability of having  secret  ballots  in  unions for  all  decisions which affect the  public.   Why not indeed? The reason  is  not hard  to  see.  Union   leadership    have  not  wanted
 them either -  they   would  reduce  their  power.    One Labor activist was heard to say that leadership was their real need -  not democracy! Honest, at least!

      
<P>   In many cases  the leaders have  represented  the views of the more  aggressive   members   of  the  union.  But  decisions,  to 'stick' in the longer term,  will obviously be better if they reflect the subject    the genuine  agreement of the membership. (Parliament did you say? There too, obviously!)      
<P>    The   claim   is  that secret ballots  are   too   long-winded  because   members  would  have  to be given a postal  ballot  to encompass the  whole  membership.  But  when  a  decision is made   in a meeting by a show of  hands,  there  is  no  concern  about  the
views, or votes, of members not present.    
    There  is no good reason why a ballot of members at a  meeting  should   not be  held, for any decision affecting the public,  or  for any  decisions  concerning  the members for that matter.     
    If   the  attending members are sufficient for a final  decision  by a  show  of hands, then  they  most certainly are   also sufficient for  a decision by a  secret ballot  in  the  meeting.  In any case, this would  more  accurately   reflect   the  actual   views 
of the  members present. And many more will  attend   when   they  know they  have an   unimpeded opportunity to vote in the meeting  by  ballot.     
   And  the   new   possibility  of fair  decisions,  by  ballot,  would also certainly encourage the airing of dissenting views  in   the meeting.                           
  
<P>  The  real  need is for government which can  achieve  all-round justice in the workplace, and have the kind of public respect  to enable  it  to successfully deal with any  <I>sticky</I>  problems 
which may arise.
<P> It  is  clear  that, when there are
problems,  only  real  democracy  in our  government  system  will enable  fairness   to   prevail,  with  reasonable consideration for all aspects  of  the  problems  involved. Broad-brush decisions, made for  
'political'   reasons, are  not good enough.   Good  democratic  government  is what everyone needs. Party government cannot produce it.
<P>Conservative government sees unions as an unnecessary threat to important progress, and longs to curtail their power and influence. But as long as untrustworthy governments (i.e. party governments) persist, unions will be needed to protect the weak against the strong. <P>Using the ballot can make them both stronger and better representatives on behalf of their workers.<P>
        
<P>        There<B> is</B> a better way. <P>
