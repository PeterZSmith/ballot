<h2> 
A Common-sense Democracy  </h2> <br /> 

  
What a shambles democracy is, the way we currently play this game.<br />  <br />
But it’s no game, while arguing between the opposed interests grows heated.<br />
And where is the logic and the calm reasoning? While there is, in the end, a rational solution to every problem, can it be found in this climate of antagonism, which is generated by the fear that bad solutions might triumph.<br /> <br />
 
  

Are we, as a people, really happy with this, so gross, system? Why are we so willing to put up with a system operating so dysfunctionally? Of what are we so afraid?<br /><br />

	 
Would a move to a ballot parliament with MPs all independent be so difficult?<br /> <br />

Let’s consider.<br />  
Firstly, representatives will engage transparently and honestly with constituents, their careers being entirely dependent on their relationships with their constituents. Initially perhaps difficult, they would soon grow in stature as statesmen/women, aware that other interests, beyond the local, must not be ignored.<br />
Next, what extra burdens would we, as citizens, have to bear? The answer is ‘None’, unless we should want to.<br /> <br />

What options would there be for anyone wanting to have some involvement?<br />
<ol>
  <li>The opportunity to attend regular community sessions for discussion of any public matter, conducted by the sitting member.
 <li>Participation in discussions with informed and intelligent constituents, together seeking good answers to difficult questions.
 <li>Learning to understand and concede the validity of the needs (and possibly the opinions!) of others, in a context of confidence in the fairness of the process and the increasing success of calm and logical debate.
