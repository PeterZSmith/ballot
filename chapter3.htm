 Political organisations begin as an
answer to chaos. The need to crystallise thought and effect the compromises
which are required to change conflict and debate into worthwhile decisions,
produced unions, factions, lobbies and political parties. But, since all power
sources are in conflict one with another, it follows logically that the
creation of order through strong groups and leadership eventually ends in
bigger conflicts. The formation of such groups creates the very powers that
aggravate the problems for other groups. Thus the brainstorming that should work toward beneficial conclusions
deteriorates into a hardening of mental positions around ideologies and the
self-centered interests they support.  <P>

 Political parties surfaced in Australia early in the 20th century, as an answer to the unbridled individualism of the Members - chaos in parliament. While politicians each
pursue their own agendas the common good is ignored and chaos ensues. Now we are seeing the parties producing their own brand of chaos - more powerfully. Anyone watching the puerile antics of party heavies in parliament and on television, must be entirely revolted and
discouraged to the point of despair. The battles of the parties, each for their
respective publics, is creating a parliament which is strong to do wrong but
very weak to do right, by reason of the close balance of power between
Government and Opposition. Thus the important and more difficult problems
become intractable.  <P>

 This editorial speaks plainly of our problem democracy: <P> 

 <ul>The Australian political system is one of the best in
the world, but it has its drawbacks. It proves too often to be a
less-than-ideal place in which to sensibly debate issues of complexity and
moment. It is prone to favour the loudest and most rhetorical, and encourages
factionalism, with its attendant arm-twisting and brutishness. </ul> <P>

 There are many
echoes of this view. The system is dominated by the special interests of political parties, pressure groups and lobbyists, each with their own mentors, backers and financial supporters. 
 How did all this happen? <P> 

 In 1904 the arrival of party politics in the new Federal Parliament was 'celebrated' by the
<i>Bulletin</i>, with a picture depicting Caliban raping Miranda - and captioned
as democracy being raped by the parties. This was the origin of the Labor Party - celebrating fifty years since Eureka. (One can sense   Establishment concern in the Bulletin's contribution.)<P>

 In 1911, Hillaire Belloc wrote a scathing attack on the party system in England. As he saw it, parliament was actually controlled by the very people who should be under the control of
parliament. If that is true for this country also (and who can doubt it?) then
the term 'democracy' has little relevance to our political life or systems.
Money and organised political 'muscle' are the key elements in the political
equation. Those are the effective secrets to the acquisition and the retention
of power.  <P>

 The troubled nature of party government is ruining 'democracy'. It seems that with all our
cleverness in all sorts of directions, we have utterly failed to find the
reasons for the ineptitude of this style of government to secure peace and
prosperity in the countries where it is practised. As Churchill said:
'democracy is the worst form of government - with the exception of all the
others'. Is there any good reason why, in this age, so smart at many things, a
more effective form of really democratic organisation can't be found? Very
often, change occurs when people get desperate, but inevitably the same kind of 
organisation, or worse,
results with the new leaders - often some form of dictatorship. Change by
tumult is never good. A heavy price is paid by the people for any benefit
gained. Democracy calls for intelligent dissent and rational change.  <P>

 <B><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Parliament </FONT></CENTER></B><P>
 
 Political power
operates through Parliament, which is the source of power under the <b>Australian
Constitution</b>. The problem is that the power of parliament has been
subjected to a 'takeover' - a hijack rather. The power accumulated by the
winning party gives it a stranglehold over the parliament, which is then at the
mercy of that party for its ensuing term of office. The real role of parliament
- to govern - is subverted. Parliament does not, indeed cannot, govern. The
winning party governs. The fact that this situation does not have popular
approval does not in any way dissuade the various ones responsible from
continuing in this fashion.  <P>

 No one seems
troubled by the fact that the Constitution makes no provision for the party
system. The political parties in the House of Commons were not rigid as in
Australia, and crossing the floor was not considered a dishonourable option. Churchill
belonged to both the Conservatives and the Liberals during his stormy career,
and in World War 2 presided over a 'Grand Coalition' with ministers from both
Conservative and Labour Parties. Although it was no doubt expected in 1901 that
parties would emerge, they were not considered essential, nor worthy of
official recognition in the Constitution. <P>

 Parliament has
become largely irrelevant to the function of government, real politics being subverted by the process known as 'politics' - party-politics. People put up with it only because they
believe that there is no other viable alternative. But there must be!  
 <P>
 The major parties'
concentration on using their power stultifies the whole process of debate, and
prevents a cooperative involvement in the formulation of sound policies; the
making of right decisions. No matter how right party decisions may seem to them
to be at the time, the fact that they can be made without serious public
consultation, or in defiance of public opinion, establishes their violation of
democratic principle. Much time is spent in parliament with speeches of set
length, with much time wasted in attempting to boost personal reputation and/or
protect and enhance party image. The various times for speeches, provided by the relevant parliamentary
Standing Order, are often far beyond the requirements of an objective treatment
of the matter in hand. So the speeches are padded out with a defence of the
party and/or attacks on the rival party to use up the allotted time. As a
result, the process of debate is frequently as boring as it could well be,
which is, of course, why the regular broadcasts of Parliament are so often
ignored.  <P>

 This, combined
with the fact that decisions are not made in parliament, explains why Members
desert the Chamber until, often enough, few are left. Some will be talking
together, ignoring the speeches, another will be reading papers, and still
another, a newspaper. In the circumstances, it is not surprising that we do not
have continuous television coverage of parliamentary proceedings. It would be too embarrassing.  <P>

 Question Time on
television, which some may find entertaining, leaves more serious viewers
disgusted at the standard of our 'democracy'. As alluded to before, school
children visiting parliament at Question Time are disgusted at the behaviour of
the politicians. What sort of social message are we sending the children by
such visits? They should be discontinued, until radical change has been
effected, and sanity and dignity are restored to parliament.  <P>

A serious problem
under the party system is that, because of the preoccupation with party
conflict, far too little time is available for the prompt and fair
consideration of community needs and aspirations. Government failure leads to
the pursuit of power by community factions in order to achieve factional aims.
If weak, their legitimate claims are liable to be ignored. If they are strong,
illegitimate claims can be successfully pressed. <P> 

  Parties and 
special-interest groups may continue to have some place in a more advanced
democracy - for a time. It is natural for people of like mind to meet to consider and
propagate their views and concerns. But the problem created by groups and
parties with preferential access to political power must be resolved.  

 Many people of
standing have criticised the party system. But while it is good for the
attention of the public to be repeatedly drawn to the failures of our
governmental system, it is not good enough to keep drawing our attention to the
problem without offering, or supporting, a real solution. We are in a political
bog, and there can be no real progress until this problem at the root of our
political life is  resolved.  <P>

The development of
power groups has excluded the possibility of useful involvement for the average
person. Politics is in the grip of the parties, which have infiltrated the
system like a virus.  
 For the ordinary
voter the party system means the passing of political power to the local
Member's party, and to the uncertain intervention of a mainly commercial media.
In neither case is there any assurance of real representation. There is no
doubt that people, as individuals, are divorced from the system, with their
only real choice confined to major party candidates, whose prime responsibility
is to their parties.  <P>

 Let's have done
with pretence. The function of government is to resolve the various differences
in community objectives with the least possible stress. But the party system of
government does not lead to consensus. Group conflicts are exacerbated by the
system, with serious casualties in the areas of truth, trust, progress and
community well being. . The constant recrimination and conflict of party
politics causes electoral cynicism and apathy. Organised groups acquire an access to the system not
available to ordinary folk, and undemocratic powers lead inexorably to their
abuse. It does not take a political scientist to observe that the party system
enables this abuse to be perpetrated and perpetuated. While the parties control
their members' voting, parliament can be no more than a mere rubber stamp for
the decisions of the ruling party and the interests they represent.  

 We are now
presented with a new morality; loyalty to the party - and to group backers of a
party. It is evident that normal concepts of conscience are not a decisive
factor. The remark &quot;Politics has nothing to do with morality&quot; is not
rare.  <P>
 
 <B><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">The Open Vote - Voting by 'divisions'. </FONT></CENTER></B><P>

 Party hierarchies have no interest in changing the system. They do not want to see parliaments
abandoning the open vote in parliament to support the opportunity for real
conscience voting by ALL Members in the House. Frustrated opposition parties
merely desire to capture the inappropriate power and privileges of the ruling
party. <P>

 Minor parties and
Independents hope to squeeze concessions out of the governing party where they
are able to exercise a balance-of-power. Without that, their influence is
negligible. With it, their influence distorts democratic government. Their
powers and responsibilities are then far too great.  <P>

 The process of
voting is inherited from the British House of Commons. When Members are to
vote, they are summoned by the ringing of bells. Arriving in the House they
queue up in their parties and vote as required by their party, their names and
votes being recorded in the permanent record in Hansard. Woe betide them if
they 'cross the floor' to vote in defiance of their party Whips!  <P>

 This procedure of
voting (by 'divisions') is archaic; a relic of the pre-electronic age! The waste
of time is one thing, but far worse is the openness of voting which supports
the controls of the party system - party discipline and 'toeing the party
line'.  <P>

 It is the open
vote in our parliaments that permits the marshalling of Members into opposing teams
instead of one cooperative body; one which could give the kind of constructive
leadership and progress we need. A comment was heard in a medical waiting room:
&quot;They should work together. It's logical&quot;. One could hardly argue.  <p>

  We will have
little or no useful grass-roots participation, far too much apathy and
cynicism, far too little justice, and far too little progress, until our
political system is remodelled on a much sounder, more democratic basis.  <p>

 We need Homer's
'Mutual aid and mutual confidence', but these are just the very things that the
party system of government does not give us.  
<P>
 The deepening
problems of our state, our country, and our region, not to mention the world,
depend for their solution on our finding a more effective way of decision-making;
one that wins the confidence of the people by reason of the effectiveness and
justice of its operation; and in a much calmer and much more objective
atmosphere. <P>
 
 <B><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Our Representatives  </FONT></CENTER></B><P>

 Party candidates,
and Members of Parliament, come and go, and are usually known personally to
very few of us. The Member can take up individual matters, but will usually be
helpless to initiate substantial necessary change - even though as one Liberal
Member (now retired) said: &quot;Philosophically, I agree with you&quot;. - in
relation to the suggested change to parliamentary voting with the secret
ballot!  <P>

 Thus apathy
abounds, despite the fact that real politics concerns the objective issues
vital to us all. While real politics is about the issues, the real
preoccupation of present &#8216;politics&#8217; is power, in the pursuit of which the
system feeds off the self-interest of the people. Its operation is anti-social.<P>
 
 After an election,
constituents receive little significant attention from the Member. A common
complaint about politicians is: &quot;They are falling all over you when there
is an election, and after the election they don't want to know you.&quot;  <P>

 Firstly, party
responsibility takes up a major amount of time and energy, while secondly, as
mentioned above, the Member's powers to act positively and effectually on
behalf of the electorate are circumscribed by party policies and priorities. So
the public sees little point in attending public meetings, which are
consequently rarely held by Members of Parliament (except maybe at election
times).  <P>

 Totalitarian
societies and Western democracies suffer from a very similar disease - the
ready access to power. The abuse of power leads directly to the exclusion of
the input and judgment of the people. The kinds of people who are able to capture
power are merely different, with different environments and different ways of
achieving their purposes.  <P>

 By tolerating the
party system we have sold our democratic birthright, the democratic right and
duty of self-government. With the control of voting by the parties in the House
we may know how they vote, but that does not mean that we are happy,   nor do we have any power to do
anything about it. Accountability
to the people is negligible.  <P>

 At present the
major policy thrust is by the parties in their private meetings, with policies
being held back by Oppositions for purposes of election strategy rather than
being brought forward in accordance with public need and real concern. Election
platforms are often suspect, reflecting ideological stances and considerations
of what will keep or win power for their parties. Party hierarchies have no
interest in changing the situation, even claiming to follow democratic
principles of representation. Nor do Independents and minor parties, being
content to exercise such powers as are open to them under the system. Various
ones have clearly demonstrated that this is so by their lack of interest in the
need for reform.  <P>

 The Rev. Fred Nile
has stated that he wants a conscience vote on abortion so that he can publish
the votes of Members in their electorates. Despite the seriousness of the
issue, that seems like political pressure rather than a genuine appeal to
conscience. (I understand that he does support the principle of CIR - Direct
Democracy. But if the Christian church   cannot awaken
the public conscience on this issue, party government cannot cure the evil by
legislation and force.  <P>

 Can politics
'purge the system', while genuine politics (the interplay of dialogue and
debate, of all sorts, on the issues at all levels of society) is paralysed by
the power plays of party politics? The real way is for 'persuasion politics' -
where the issues are preeminent, because they are decided by ballot.  <P>

 Simple democracy
demands that party power, (the control of voting), be eliminated from
parliament. The Members must be freed from this control, so that they can be
direct representatives of their electorates, giving the people renewed hope for
just and effective government.  

 One of the
notorious effects of party politics in parliament is the time wasted in
'divisions' - the process of summoning the Members into the House (often nearly
empty) to vote. They may even enter the House asking what the vote is about and
which way they are required to vote. As can be imagined, the process is a
substantial waste of time, with nothing whatever to commend it.  <P>

 Apparently,
consideration was given at one time to saving parliamentary time by using
electronic voting in parliament; though not secret. It was clear that such a
facility would save time. But it was 'scotched' for an interesting reason. It
was felt that the Opposition's power to make its presence felt in the House was
already severely limited. It would therefore be unwise, it was decided, to
remove its remaining power - that of disrupting the progress of opposed
legislation by the delaying tactic of calling for a division!  <P>

 The voting procedures of Parliament must
be changed. The system of open voting has entrenched the 'party system', with
its consequential 'limpets', the multitude of lobbies and pressure groups.
Members of parliament must be freed from the compulsion of party line voting.  <P>

 This change would
also enable Members of Parliament to truly represent their electorates, freed
from party control, all being free to exercise their individual talents within
the House. And, with parliament thus able to respond freely to the objective
argument of any of its Members, the operation of parliament would have a
refreshing democratic character.  
 
  
 
 <P>	 
 <B><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Election Antics</FONT></CENTER></B> <P>

 Public debate, centering on the one or two key issues
of the election, highlights the democratic poverty of 'representative'
government, in the throes of party politics. How can we have any influence on
decisions on the many issues, when we only have a choice as to which of the
major parties will win office; nothing else. Party politics has emasculated
representative government, authority of Parliament, and the separation of
powers, the major components of the
Westminster System.  

 <P>We may be a clever people, but we are so stuck in our
ways that we cannot apply our undoubted ability to the simple task of
modernising our political system. Meanwhile the rest of the world is falling
apart trying to operate under the same stupid fallacy - that party politics is
essential to democracy, rather than being, as it is, its executioner.  

 <P>Under party rule the electorate has limited options
for voting. The parties dominate, and steam-roll the electorate with massive,
expensive campaigns at each election. As a rule, only the major parties gain
seats in the House of Representatives, the primary House of government; and
they are not much loved, as they are felt to be self-serving, but the
compulsion to fill all squares on the voting paper ensures that the transfer of
preferences will all go to one or other of the main parties. Rarely can an
Independent succeed. But an occasional
Independent is not a real advance toward democracy as government normally has
enough voting power under the party system to neutrallise an Independent.  <P>

 In 'safe' seats, those voting for a losing party are
consistently disfranchised. They are politically impotent, especially where
issues important to them are decided on the basis of doctrinaire considerations
- as is usual. So, many active party members from hopeless seats campaign
extensively in marginal seats on behalf of their party. No doubt this is
considered appropriate under the party system. But the notion of electorates
being invaded by resources of money and personnel from other electorates would
be unwelcome, and ineffective. 
<P>
 <FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER>Longer Terms</CENTER></B> </FONT><P>
 
 Elections may be for periods of three, or four years,
five in Britain. The extraordinary thing is the pretence of democracy when the
blatant wish of governments is to make decisions over longer periods without
any reference to the people. And the desire for longer parliamentary terms is
bi-partisan! It is claimed that there is a need for time to implement the
'hard' decisions; i.e. not bothering to secure community agreement – or sometimes
defying community opinion.  <P>

 No doubt the
parties would relish the chance to dispense with public opinion. Longer terms
would enable them to ignore the electorate more than ever. One <i>curly</i>
suggestion made, was that parliament should suspend elections, sit 30 days only
in the year, and vote secretly - a really totalitarian combination! And by a
one time Democrat! Beat that!  <P>

 It is claimed we need a greater stability. But the
only stability offered by the party system is at the expense of real,
democratic, representation by Members of Parliament. The whole purpose of
longer terms is to be able to make decisions that cannot be hindered by
unorganised popular opinion. The silent majority may not like the proposed
actions of government, but party power seriously hinders involvement, rendering
effective dissent very difficult. Party government thrives on the helplessness
and short memory of the public.  <P>

 The drive for longer terms is evidence of the parties'
lack of commitment to democracy. It is ironic that, in the 'Era of Democracy'
(1850s), terms were reduced from five years to three, to '<i>improve democracy</i>'!
They even wanted one-year terms. In East Timor at present, such short-term
government could speed up progress and development. The axe needs to fall quickly where successful candidates have nothing but their popularity going for them. There’s too much to be done for
that.<P>
 <B><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Secrecy </FONT></CENTER></B><P>
 
 From a leading newspaper: ‘One of the
great strengths of our system over many years has been its transparency.’
Really! If, indeed, the ramifications of government were transparent, then
corruption, malpractice, and incompetence, would vanish in the glare of press
and public scrutiny. And, there would be no need for Freedom of Information,
investigative journalism, Royal Commissions or any other enquiries.  <P>

 Secrecy reigns in government, with Cabinet secrecy
supported by the secrecy provisions of the Public Service. These provisions
forbid the disclosure of any matter whatsoever, whether or not the public
interest is affected. The only release from the oath of secrecy for the public
servant is death.  <P>

 These draconian provisions ensure that any
embarrassing information about the actions or inaction of government and
bureaucracy will not be disclosed to parliament, or people, except at very
considerable risk to the author of the 'leak'. And we have just seen government
treading down the Auditor General's report of disturbing expenditure and
financial transactions – just as in Victoria previously. What's the point of
audit reports if autocratic government can so cavalierly dismiss them – and the
auditors?  <P>

 The far-too-rigid secrecy provisions owe their very
existence to the paranoia that party governments feel about the public and the
Opposition knowing what they are up to. And, of course, the Opposition is
generally content to have the same control if, and when, it regains power.  <P>

 We know something of the zeal with which governments
pursue the matter of leaks. The case of the Customs officer who stopped a
Cabinet Minister with his contraband colour TV illustrates the isolation of the
public servant. He was 'crucified' for doing his public duty. One wonders
whether the more senior officer(s) who overrode him suffered any adverse
consequences. <P>

 With the Opposition denied access to the Public
Service, and secrecy surrounding all Cabinet operations, it is obvious that
Parliament's power has been demolished, and that the cover-up of government
activity is aimed at the preservation of the image and power of the party in
power.  <P>

 <P>
 <FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER>Debate and Secrecy  </CENTER></B> </FONT><P>

 There is a place where secrecy is right and a place
where it is wrong. Debate should not be secret, but the real debate is not in
parliament. It should be, but you can't have real debate where there is no
chance for it to lead to a decision. Mention has been made already of the
contrast between the operation of Parliament and the Constitutional Convention,
where debate <i>did </i>lead to decisions - by secret ballot. <P>

 For the people
to have confidence in government it is essential that the reasons for decisions
made are evident. Open debate
culminating in the secret ballot is the only way the public can be satisfied
that decisions are made for the right reasons and respect the process of
government. The people, who must submit to those decisions, are entitled to
that assurance. Only then can the people have the necessary confidence in
government, and respect for the nation's institutions.<P> 

 Commenting on the Secret Ballots in Parliament
proposal, in the Melbourne <b><i>Age</i></b> some time ago, Barry Jones,
one-time M.H.R, asked sarcastically,  
&quot;Do we want secret <i>debate</i> as well?” Not brilliant!  

 It is quite important to realise that what we have <i>now</i>
is secret debate - in the party rooms and in Cabinet; where the actual
decisions are made. The real, <i>effective</i> debate must occur <i>in</i> the House. Only by cancelling the power  parties,  to control the votes of their members in the House, can this be done. The wrong place for
secrecy is the debate. The right, and vitally necessary place for secrecy is the
vote in the House. 

  <P>
 <FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER>Accountability of Government </CENTER></B> </FONT><P> 

 It is often assumed that our representatives are
sufficiently accountable to us in the electorate at present - through the
election process. The vote looms large in the minds of many, as it is the only
way we have to make the Member of Parliament accountable.  
But that is basically no more than a power to punish, not to exercise any
influence with regard to our Member's <i>representation on individual issues of concern. </i> 
We have very little, if any, opportunity to participate in the <i>decisions </i>that
are made; only an extremely limited say in <i>who </i>will make the decisions.
We are allowed to <i>elect<b> </b></i>the people dished up to us, but never to <i>decide</i>
<i>the issues</i> that trouble us.  <P>

      We are far too isolated from those whose responsibility it is to represent us.
They are much too involved in the power game to be bothered with us as
individuals. Some solve the problem by forming more pressure groups, thus
accentuating the problem for the rest of us, who have neither the time nor the
nature for that kind of aggressive activity - unless we boil over! Scratch any
member of the community and you will find repressed anger. No wonder so many
are on medication!  

 Where can concerned citizens seek to bring health to
the political system by regular, local, issue-based involvement, adding their
presence and voices, along with local and other media, to community debate? One
cannot form an active pressure group to equally represent the whole community,
from 'outside the system'. (The Electoral Council Movement aimed to do
that. Possibly it could be done so with
all meetings conducted by ballot for all decisions. This could, perhaps,
preclude a takeover by specific interests.) <P>
 
 A regular, local, non-partisan,
meeting, freely accessible to the whole community,  
could  only originate from the local Representative wanting to keep in regular
contact with the constituents. The
question is: &quot;Why don't they?&quot; The answer is that they do not depend
on the people for reelection. It is the party that enables them to be
reelected.   

 In the United
States they complain that whereas   local Members once kept close and were very
assiduous in cultivating the constituents, now they look to the big
corporations for the campaign money needed for big television advertising etc.,
and they don't need the locals much any more!  

 It's much the same here. The political muscle,
provided by organisation and advertising money, is only accessible to the
parties and groups that have their own axe to grind. Their vested interests predominate;
subverting democracy. <P>

 Let's face it; advances in democracy never came
easily. One can think of the Suffragettes and the Eureka Stockade - examples of
the effort and sacrifice such advances can take. An improved democracy will require some solid thinking, and perhaps courageous action. <P>

 What then is
the answer? The power of the parties lies in the disciplined, obedient
behaviour of party politicians, who must do as they are told, to protect and
advance their careers; voting consistently along the party line. The open vote
enables this discipline and control by party hierarchies, operating with one
eye on the funds supplied by their backers. <P>
<br>
The introduction of the secret ballot into our parliaments is the <i>only</i>
way<b><i> </i></b>we could restore truly democratic parliamentary government.
But how? Only by public participation. <br>
There are quite a few who would be glad to participate in regular conference
meetings with the local Member, to support, query, challenge, even be a rival
to the member. That meeting place would be a Mecca to all when controversy
arises.  <P>

 Meanwhile there would be constant low-key surveillance
of, and publicity of, the local Member's performance. After all it is not the
open vote in parliament that will make the local Member accountable, but the
intimate local knowledge of the Member's attitudes, policies, debating in
parliament, and above all, efforts and success in working for the electorate's
overall interests and views.  <P>

 The Member can be respected and remain unchallenged
only by supplying constituents with unswerving loyalty. Intimate local
knowledge of the Member is the real key to continual accountability. A
party-line vote is a vote for the party’s interests. It cannot be called
representation of the community interest.  <P>

 Which introduces another question. What party
supporter agrees with every solitary thing in the party's forever-changing
platform? Whether we like it or not, the party platform (or some unexpected
variation) is what the party we vote for (or give our preference to) will feel
free to pursue. This is the status quo;
our so-called democracy. And unless we find the courage for change, the only
changes that will happen are the ones we don't like - originating from
dictatorial party government. <P>

 Robbie Sefton, a regional communications specialist, from
Coonabarabran, N.S.W., says:
&quot;People want a level of ownership over politicians; the people who are
making the decisions...&quot; There's the rub. They make the decisions but we
don’t own, or control, them. The decisions are not the people's decisions. The
people don't have a voice in the decisions governing their lives. We don't  
 ‘own’ our representatives.  <P>

 Party representatives listen with their ears but not
with their hearts. Their hearts belong to their parties not to the people. They
have sold their parliamentary votes for election finance and support, party
endorsement and their leader’s coat tails. No doubt many of them wish it were
otherwise but they have no choice. They are not free to follow the conviction
of their own hearts. Their true style is often hidden until they retire.
Ideally, they should be able to show their true colours and have the public
support them for their stand on controversial issues. That is a distant dream
until Parliament embraces the democratic voting procedure of the secret ballot.
<P>

 We, the people, are not free from blame. We weakly
acquiesce, because we are too apathetic to join the fight to demolish the party
system, which freely creates this corruption of democracy. We have a false
democracy. Politics is 'party' politics and decisions are determined by <i>party
power</i>, not by free and open debate, in community and parliament. <P>

 A party government may stray markedly from its base,
its electing constituents. It is apparent that governments, indulging in the
idea of a mandate, do as they think fit. The 'Government', is also far from
accountable to the Parliament, which is defeated continuously by the ruling
party's command of its Members' votes.  

 <P>The power of the Opposition is emasculated. Debate can
be gagged at will by the government; all-party-committee recommendations can be
easily ignored in Parliament; legislation can be, and often is, rushed through
in the closing session of parliament without opportunity for appropriate debate
or consideration. The ruling party appoints the Speaker, who controls the
operation of the House, not necessarily
impartially.<P>

 The more significant influences to bear on the
government are a selection of groups - each with its own agenda - the press and
TV journalists, the opinion pollsters, and the lobbies and pressure groups;
none of which should have the kind of influence they have. Their influence fills the vacuum left by
the practical exclusion of accountability of each Member to the people in the
electorate – a flawed system. <P>

 With a real democracy we would acquire a real
accountability of the executive to Parliament, and the accountability of
Parliament to the people by virtue of the accountability of each Member to the
electorate. None of this happens at present.  
 
 <P>
 <FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER> Accountability of the executive </CENTER></B> </FONT><P>
 
 A matter that
has long concerned  political commentators is
the dominance of the executive over the parliament itself. <P> 

 The executive is the inner circle of the Cabinet, the
Ministers closest to the Prime Minister or Premier. More-junior ministers have
much less influence. The power of those in charge becomes institutionalised, so
that their authority is virtually unassailable. Parties will   support a leader even when disagreeing with the direction taken, since not doing so will damage the image of the leader and the standing of the party. It has been said that leaders can virtually do as they
please so long as they look like winners!  <P>

 In past days Jeff Kennett (once Premier of Victoria)
 described the suggestion for a parliament based on the secret ballot for all
decisions, as dangerously simplistic! Simply dangerous, rather, to his beloved
party system - which so kindly opened the door for him to dictatorial power -
for a time. One would think that there could be nothing so dangerously
simplistic as the mad rush to privatise all our public assets; in the name of
ideology.  <P>

 Paul Keating in his heyday as Treasurer reached such
an impregnable position that while there were severe doubts that his economic
policies were soundly based, and not merely some out-of-place economic dogma
inherited from an earlier period, he was able to brush off criticism with
simplistic reassurances, and be largely untouched when challenged about the
errors in past predictions, even though he was obviously floundering at the
time. He is not the only one! The leash of accountability needs to be shorter,
much shorter.<P>

 All ideas, be they of the left or the right side of
politics, based on a blind adherence to ideology, are fraught with danger. And
the relentless pursuit of the Victorian Auditor General to reduce his office,
emasculating his powers, seems to have had much more to do with his criticism
of the Kennett government’s activities than economic efficiency. <P>

 Much media attention is given to party leaders – much
more than to decisions. Little thought is devoted to how politics might produce
better decisions in a calmer, more intelligent atmosphere. <P>
<ul>
 'The ownership
of industrial production promoted the polarisation of ideology and its
attendant political conflict. Questions of governance in this century have
focused on little else.'<sup>9</sup>.</ul> <P>

 The bitter contest between Left and Right in Russia is
wrecking the country, showing the manifest failure of the West's free market
philosophy to 'save' the country from its ruinous path. The sudden rush to a
new ideology was never going to succeed. That's the problem with ideology - it
ignores the realities, while trying to make the people fit its ideas. As Latham
says, there has been no real attempt to focus on a better basis for making
political decisions. The world has sown to the wind of partisan politics, and
it is reaping the whirlwind of serious failure in country after country. When
punch-ups occur in parliaments and ethnic tensions are often expressed with guns
and bombs, there is no doubt democracy is not winning. We need to show a better
way.  

   <P>
 <FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER>The Old 'Mandate' Trick </CENTER></B> </FONT><P>

 The claim leaders make for a mandate reminds one of
the estate agent whose socks bore the legend 'Trust Me'! We should not be
deciding important matters based on <b><i>who</i></b><i> </i>proposes the
policy. But party government easily becomes the toy of autocrats.<P>

 While the calibre of competing politicians is far from
unimportant, without an understanding of the issues at stake, which are many,
to be forced to simply vote for one party leader against another, means that
the public has no input on the issue at all. There is much more at stake than a
leaders' reputation.  <P>

 A mandate (if any) is a trust, not an endorsement of
power. For a leader to assume a mandate for a whole raft of policies, and even
more for a difficult one that is little understood, flies in the face of fact.
Usually, electoral success says little more than that the new leader is
mistrusted less than the opponent. For a clever country, the political process
does not make us look too clever at all.<P>

 People with high responsibilities must exercise powers
of decision that they have been given, or permitted to assume. But this is a
trust. All delegated power is thus limited to the delegation intended by the
giver of the trust. Such delegation can only be acceptable if parliament (on
behalf of the people) has the power to arrest or correct inappropriate
executive action, and in an appropriately brief time frame.<P>

The present latitude, i.e. the period until the next
election, is far too long. It is too long for the people, as it is important
that the joint wisdom of the many be able to impinge readily (and strongly) on the minds of those in
power; and too long for the incumbents, who can succumb to the temptations of
too great an access to power – with their dreams of a ‘mandate’.<P>

 The present system of government, with the Cabinet
formed by the ruling party, and accountability solely to the ruling party, even
the party hierarchy itself, must go. With the domination of the system by
Cabinet, there are several onerous responsibilities in the one body - the
functions of vision and policy, decision-making, administration or government,
and the 'political' responsibility to the party to retain power. This concentration
of responsibility and power is profoundly undemocratic. It is also ridiculous
as they manifestly can't cope, and incompetent government struggles to lead a
people who are troubled and fed-up. <P>

 The members of the executive, to satisfy their own ambition
to retain power and the party's demands for action, churn out legislation,
often enough unintelligible to the Members, to the public servants who have to
administer it, and to the public who must obey it. Nothing else could so
guarantee the multiplication of ill-considered legislation on the books, and
exclude the real possibility of removing, or simplifying, old legislation.  <P>

 Bad government breeds lawlessness, which leads to the
need for more government. The style of executive government we have with the
party system is bad government and bad democracy. We need <i>parliamentary</i>
government, real democracy; not presidential style government, which tends
always to autocracy, with its access to personal power. <P>

 Each Minister should be directly accountable to
Parliament as a whole. Instead they are
the front-line fighters in the party battles in Parliament - a spectacular
sideshow - being blessed by their own party and cursed by the Opposition. They
have their hands on the 'levers' of power. For Ministers, overwork and ambition
are two powerful corrosives of a real sense of responsibility to put the public
interest first. <P>

  
 <P>
 <FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER>Accountability of the Bureaucracy  </CENTER></B> </FONT><P>
 

Bureaucracy is not democratic. It is hierarchical and
authoritarian. The complexity of government means that members of the
bureaucracy, through their expertise, often have considerable influence over
Ministers, whose frequent change is a pronounced feature of the party system. <P>

The isolation of the public service, not only from
Ministers, but also from Parliament, is aggravated by the secrecy provisions,
which have the official purpose of protecting the public from misuse by
officials of confidential information. But, these stringent provisions preclude
a public servant from making any disclosure of maladministration (or worse), by
the oath demanded on appointment - even if clearly motivated by the public
interest. Hatred of disclosure pervades the whole system of government. <P>

 The secrecy provisions, complete with penalties under
criminal law, shield the public service from government, from parliament, and
from the people. <P>

 Under the Westminster system of ministerial
responsibility, Public Service department surveillance is in the hands of the
relevant Minister, the only Opposition access being the Question Time provisions, which are
routinely abused by Government. Ministers and senior officials may develop cosy relationships and
matters crying out for exposure are unlikely to receive the attention they
merit. On the other hand there is growing up within these relationships a
denial of ministerial responsibility on the basis that the minister was not
properly advised. Where then is the accountability of the Westminster System -
with no one accepting full responsibility? Where everyone shares responsibility
no one does.<P>

 Accountability of the Public Service, or rather the
lack of it, is something very familiar since the advent of the television
programme <i>Yes Minister</i>. Unfortunately this satire is not without some
foundation, and local parallels.  

 The climate created in the Public Service by the lack
of accountability results in a lowest common denominator of action. Only those
things which are <i>safe</i>, (by-the-book or have a precedent), tend to be
done. An appearance of action is a frequent substitute for real action. Once
again, secrecy protects those it shouldn't. The combination of secrecy and the
preoccupation of the parties with their political in-fighting, enables the
bureaucracy to continue in its self-protective isolation; and maladministration
and inefficiency can easily escape
notice.<P>
 
 <FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER>  Freedom of Information</CENTER></B> </FONT><P>
  
 The progressive emasculation of the Freedom of
Information provisions will, it is feared, further distance the bureaucracy
from Parliament and the people it is supposed to serve. With the secrecy provisions
properly modified, the expensive and ineffectual FOI provisions would have been
(and may in the future become) unnecessary.  

  
 
 <P>
 <FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER>Accountability of Parliament  </CENTER></B> </FONT><P>
 
 
 Parliament itself is far from accountable. It is a
nonentity. Since parties and groups dominate parliament it is not the seat of
power it should be. Accountability and responsibility are just not possible.
Accountability of parliament can only be realised as, and when, it becomes a
true House of Representatives. Two things logically go together - freedom of
Members from party control, enabling the parliament to regain control of
decision-making, and the Cabinet - and a realistic accountability of the
Members to their constituents. Only then can Members influence the decisions
made and also be required by their constituents to answer for the effectiveness
of their influence in parliament on their behalf.  <P>
 

  <UL>
 <P><B><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Accountability of Members</FONT></CENTER></B><P>
 Direct
accountability of the Members to their electorates is an absolute essential. We
don't have it. The party Member may be uneasy about the electorate, but cannot
win the confidence of the constituents. The Member blames the electorate for
being apathetic, but most voters, as already mentioned, just repress their
frustrated anger. And that is why politics is a taboo subject - the frustration
and pain are not worth it.  <P>

 The electorate
has no time for politicians whose first allegiance is to the party, and whose
power to act on its behalf is strangled by the party system. At the same time,
to vote for an Independent is seen by most as futile, as Independents cannot
compete with party machines; and their chances of election are correspondingly
small. And if elected they are in most cases merely 'a voice crying in the
wilderness'.  <P>

  Members are obliged by their endorsement to put party considerations first,
before their relations with the electorate, the chain of responsibility, which
alone could ensure democratic government, is broken down completely.
Accountability of government is therefore spasmodic and weak.  <P>

 Matters raised
with a Member get little further than the promise to 'take it up with the
party'. Some may busy themselves with assistance to individual constituents, to
enhance their image. They thus try to compensate for their inability to pursue
more serious matters to a conclusion. The knowledge that the local Member has
so little capacity to affect anything effectively discourages contact with the
very one who should be in close touch; as a strong, and single-minded representative in parliament on behalf of the people.  <P>

 Self-government
demands that government be accessible and responsive to the people. It is not.
We do not know how they vote. We do not trouble ourselves to find out. It would
make no difference if we did. Nothing will change because we think what they do
is wrong. Nor will there be an adequate
explanation of the reasons for the actions of government. No wonder there is so
much frustration. Contrast the quote from Abraham Lincoln: 'Public opinion, in
this country, is everything!' <P>

 <FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER>Question Time</CENTER></B></FONT>  <P>

 Dr. Ken.
Coghill in a speech in Traralgon reported in the Melbourne <b><i>Age</i></b>
(15/8/90) also noted the undemocratic nature of our democracy. Drawing
attention to the excessive power of the executive, he referred to the abuse of
Question Time by governments. <P>

 This abuse
destroys any semblance of accountability of Government to Parliament. The long
speeches by Ministers, little devoted to the Opposition question, and ‘Dorothy
Dix’ questions by government back-benchers, to give Ministers opportunity to
bang the party drum, are ploys by governments to circumvent the purpose of
Question Time - to make government accountable to parliament. What a joke! But
who is laughing?  <P>

 At one time the
Senate majority, of non-government Senators, decided to limit the time in the
Senate for the asking, and answering, of questions to one and two minutes
respectively. This tactic scored a point in enabling more questions to be
asked, but has probably achieved little in eliciting real answers to real
questions. The whole problem reflects, once again, the poverty of the style of
‘democracy’ that is currently practised, and the difficulty faced by those who
would hope to achieve something for the well being of our society.  <P>
 
<B> <CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Leadership</FONT></CENTER>  </B><P>

 Our political
structure consists of pyramids of power. Under the party system there is a
continual search by the parties for 'leaders'; those who can attract the
necessary support for the party to gain or retain power. Party democracies are
vulnerable to the leadership cult and commonly veer in that direction. Sir
Michael Somare, of New Guinea, once commented that the Westminster system was
no good for New Guinea - it was too much concerned with personalities. Too
true! <P>

With the
present system, leaders have power and it attracts people who want power; and
it is the battle for power which is destroying us. We have party conflict
instead of cooperative government, the setting of bad behaviour precedents
instead of constructive leadership, and community discouragement instead of a
productive calm. Some of the best-talented people refuse to be involved in this
type of scene. Thus politics is deprived of their contribution. <P>

People tend to
be ambivalent on the subject of leaders. Strong leaders appeal where pressure
for selfish interests is wanted. But not if they are in the opposite camp! They
are the 'tall poppies' to be eventually
cut down. <P>

Democracy is
always inconvenient for those who have, or desire, power. As mentioned before,
a Left-wing union activist once said, &quot;We need leadership, not
democracy.&quot; It is particularly unfortunate that there is this view that leadership
and real democracy are incompatible concepts. A true leader leads - not by
power and manipulation, but by being worth following. An autocrat does not
lead. He/she dictates. <P>

The party
system does not give promise of providing the best leadership. It provides
leaders, but the party battles preclude real leadership. It is certainly
difficult for the public to be sure who is worth trusting and following. <P>

Leaders within
the party system cannot give of their best to the public interest. The public
wants trustworthy, 'good' leaders, but the system inhibits their rise, and
destroys those who reach the top. The party system is notorious for discarding
leaders who cannot maintain or rebuild party power. <P>

Because of the
institutionalisation of power within the party system, the tendency is for
significant change to occur through leadership coups, or removal of a governing
party through an election. The value of such change is highly debatable. The
people do not trust these 'leaders'. <P>

Typically,
party-minded people want powerful leaders who can override opposition and put
the party policies into action without the agreement of those affected. This
implies a significantly dictatorial aspect to the operation of government. If
we accept that the governing party should have the power to make the 'tough',
unpopular, decisions, we are tacitly accepting minority rule, even though for a
limited period. The principle that the governed should participate in
government is therefore constantly flouted. <P>

Party
government works by tough leadership because of the hostilities and enmity it
nurtures. That is why considerable public pressures exist and at times boil
over. The view that the ruling party can have a mandate to virtually ignore the
electorate does not fit well with the democratic concept of self-government. <P>

The
party-system renders the public politically sterile, while leaders act with a
high hand. The result is that there is little explanation of policy, much
confusion, and failure of public support and cooperation, without which
difficult problems can never be resolved. <P>

It is quite
apparent that politicians are not gods, and are frequently at a loss to know
what to do, or afraid to pursue a right course when they know it. Party
politicians' viewpoints are frequently doctrinaire and sometimes merely a
reaction to other views, rather than an objective attack on the problems; so
constructive, cooperative leadership is a notable casualty. <P>

Democracy
demands a much better, more civilised approach. It is quite unacceptable that a
party elected on the basis of a party platform, should assume a blank cheque
for dictatorial action. Parties are not elected on the basis of a detailed
understanding of their platform or programme. The more likely basis is either a
blind attachment to an ideology, or more generally, leadership image and lavish
promises. Conning the public is the main preoccupation of party politics but
such behaviour would be hissed out of a real democracy. <P>

Government, in
the hands of leaders who vie for power, and come and go through party turmoil,
may have to respond at times to the whims of a self-centered, capricious
public, but that is a far cry from democratic self-government. And no country
can prosper like that. <P>

We need a new
basis of leadership - a basis in which inspiration, ideas and policies can
spring from any source, and win their own following; being derived from a
process in which all the people who wish to do so have been able to be
involved. The community could concur and cooperate, with a steadily growing
confidence, in such a process of government. <P>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER>Stability </CENTER></B></FONT> <P>

 Stability of
decisions is hard to achieve in a climate of confrontation. Fear of defeat
generates forcefulness and consequently strong reaction. The lack of
accountability of government stands out starkly when we see party governments
still in power even though their public approval ratings are low. Claiming a
mandate implies considerable opposition to the governing party's planned
action. The theory behind this democratic enigma is that to have any stability
of government, there must be the freedom to ignore the electorate for a period,
and make the tough decisions. Thus, as already noted, the only stability
offered by the party system is at the expense of true representation by Members
of Parliament. This is the dilemma of democracy - that is, the kind we have! <P>

While the
system of parties exists, it will, always and inevitably, permit power to be
exercised by organised groups and exclude power from the rest. This imbalance
creates instability of policy direction and government. <P>

Government
budgets produce public nerves due to the uncertainty of party governments'
secretly planned moves. Likewise, Oppositions avoid disclosing their ‘hand’.
The imminence of an election, with the possibility of an alternative government
and an about-face on many important issues, causes planned business actions to
be put on hold - some stability! More like inertia! And in the face of a
serious need for prompt action. <P>

Without the
resolution of the problem of the system's creation of illegitimate power,
government will continue to frustrate and annoy. We may have 'stability of
government', but only for the short term and at the expense of our country's
real potential and real quality of life. Seesaw government is inevitable under
the party system, and that is not the stability we need to enhance the life of
the nation.<P>

<B><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Demonstrations</FONT></CENTER></B><P>

 Without better
participatory mechanisms Western political culture has become used to accepting
aggressive demonstrations as a necessary part of democracy. Do we want better
democracy so that we can register a protest about things that concern us; have
some control over our lives, without the confrontation of angry, shouting
demonstrations? <P>

A few simple
rules could improve public understanding of difficult problems, upgrade our
democracy, and save some broken heads. <P>

 <OL> <LI>No demonstration should ever be permitted near its target. The power of force has no legitimate part in the makling of democratic decisions.<BR>

<LI> Upon application, any minority should be given a public venue with equal opportunity
for antagonists and protagonists to be heard under conditions of controlled
debate.  <BR>

 <LI> The debate should be given adequate time, and appropriate coverage by television
stations, and  <br>
<LI>  Government should underwrite the cost. It would be much less than that
incurred in the normal rowdy protest, considering also the general cost of
community disruption.  </OL><P>
 

 Minorities have
a democratic right to be heard, otherwise 'rule by the people' becomes a
tyranny by the majority; which is often unthinking, often confused by a lack of
real information. Majorities are not right all the time. Democracy is not about force. It is about
sharing information and giving others the (inestimable) right to be heard - so
that sensible decisions can be made, without regrets. <P>

By characterising
the violent confrontation of a One Nation meeting as a 'defence' of tolerance,
Pamela Bone<sup>10</sup>, complicated an already complex issue. Things that
disturb people and result in demonstrations are usually those that governments
handle badly. <P>

What is so
lacking at the top is the willingness to publicly proclaim moral positions. For
example it is wrong and, surely un-Australian, to belittle, intimidate or
otherwise harass another law-abiding person for any reason whatsoever. A Prime
Minister is in the position to say so publicly and to say so strongly. Would
that really be so courageous? Racism is very much alive and well in this
country needing positive statements of principle from 'the bridge', which could
markedly change the rot in our national values of tolerance - our 'fair go'
heritage. Making a political battleground out of such issues can only make
matters worse. 'Be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good'. In other
words attack the 'message', not 'the messenger'. <b>Anti-social views need to
be publicly condemned - from the’top’.</b> <P>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER>Freedom of Speech </CENTER></B></FONT><P>

There appears
to be considerable confusion regarding this so-called 'right'. It is quite
elementary that all freedoms have limits. The concept of unlimited freedom is
contrary and offensive to the egalitarian spirit of democracy. <P>

Anything that
publicly causes offence to another (e.g. an aboriginal football player)
requires a <b><i>sincere</i></b> public apology by the offender. And only
person able to judge whether the sincerity is genuine, and sufficient to
liquidate the affront, is the one offended. No offence can be justified on the
ground of freedom of speech. Similarly, in the case of an article in Rabelais<sup>11</sup>, alleged to 
contain an incitement to the crime of shoplifting, the defence <b><i>can not</i></b>
be 'freedom of speech'. <P>

Democracy is
mistaken by many to mean absolute freedom. Unless we get our minds straight on
this we make a mockery of democracy. Democracy is about the right to live in a
society well ordered by self-government. Freedom without order is a myth. We may be free to rob a bank but all
our freedom will evaporate with the clang of the steel door! Freedom is the
product of <b><i>good</i></b> government. Obviously the way to real and lasting freedom can only be found in the persistent pursuit of real democracy. The calls for
freedom have a common cause - the lack of real democratic government. To look
for freedom elsewhere is a false lead. Other than in the realm of good
government, efforts to secure freedom will do more damage to freedom than good.
The USA has a Bill of Rights. Does it ensure freedom for them? <P>

<B><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Freedom and Violence</FONT></CENTER></B><P>

Freedom of
expression does NOT mean the right to shout others down, to demonstrate
aggressively, or otherwise intimidate or threaten the right of others to <i>their</i>
freedom of expression, regardless of how passionately we may disagree with
their views. Democracy must mean that Pauline Hanson or any one else has a
perfect right to call a public meeting, unhindered by contrary opinion. There
is a misconception that the principle of democracy endorses demonstrations
which confront. It does not. <P>

Representation
under the party system is representation of parties, not the people. Many
things worry the people but we have no effective say. The problem of
demonstrations will inevitably continue until reforms which give concerned
people a realistic say in matters of public concern are implemented. Only then
can government have the moral authority to protect its citizens' clear
entitlement to free speech within a well ordered society, with community peace
and harmony. <P>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER>The Local Member</CENTER></B></FONT> <P>

The party
system in parliament has been an obstacle to the entry of the best candidates
into the field. As we have noted, the party candidate is quite commonly not
even known in the electorate, let alone well known, and, as often as not, a
'good' Member, losing the seat in a swing away from the party, will vanish
without trace. There is normally no sign of opposing candidates between
elections, as there is no ongoing local forum for them to function. All local
action is thus postponed until election time ensuring that there can be no
ongoing effective critique of the Member's performance, and the electorate does
not have ideal or stable representation by a well known and widely trusted
Member.

<B><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Lobbies and Pressure Groups</FONT></CENTER></B><P>

 A serious evil
of the party system is the frequency with which the two major parties are so
evenly supported that a large number of lobby interests, pressure groups, and
minor parties, and/or Independents, are able to exert an influence on
government disproportionate to their numbers. While a minor group may have a
case that deserves consideration, it is the ability to force favourable
decisions against majority opinion that is disturbing - and wrong. <P>


The number of
different interests employing this method of political influence has increased
markedly over recent years. Many groups, such as doctors and nurses and
specialists, have been formed to operate in this way, the members of which
would have disdained to do so in days gone by. One writer, so far from decrying
such activity, blamed weaker groups for not doing the same thing!  Such is the
landslide toward the pursuit of power in a society that is rapidly losing all
faith in its governing process.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER>Election Platforms </CENTER></B></FONT><P>

In having no
other option than voting for parties, voters are forced to vote against their
own wishes on many issues. There is no opportunity for people to have any
influence on specific matters. We have no choice. We are not offered, nor can
we claim, a say on each issue. At each election for the House of
Representatives, we vote in the end, willy nilly, for the major parties and
their platforms; like it or not. The options offered are circumscribed by the
non-optional preferential voting system, any voting paper not complete with the
major party candidates’ names not being counted. Thus the major parties get all
the votes. The country is therefore saddled with the winning executive's
policies for the duration of the following parliamentary term; while the
Opposition, whose ideas on some matters at least could merit majority support,
simply pound against the government's defences like the ocean surf on a rocky
headland! What political helplessness is theirs, and ours! What hindrances
these things are to sound government! What a silly system!
<P>
Being forced to
vote for parties leaves us no other choice than an odd and unsatisfactory mix
of policies and personalities; or to cast an informal vote.

<B><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Referenda </FONT></CENTER></B><P>

 Party-government
motives for promotion of referenda are notoriously suspect. Consequently they
are usually rejected. Now the idea of Citizen Initiated Referenda (CIR) or
Direct Democracy, is gaining attention; i.e. referenda, which it is
mandatory for Government to put to the people upon submission of petitions
signed by a specified number of voters. See Chapter 4.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><CENTER>Citizen Electoral Councils</CENTER></B></FONT><P>

There have been
moves in some areas for the introduction of Citizen Electoral Councils, to
enable community discussion, and to put forward Independent candidates. It is
claimed that these Councils would be open to everyone to participate equally.
But that is the kind of basis on which the Communist Party was meant to operate
in the USSR and China. That the will of the people (the 'dictatorship of the
proletariat'?) could not survive in this kind of context has been amply
demonstrated.  <P>

All political (and other) groups tend to become the preserve of the vocal few - the
democratic dilemma. Ordinary folk cannot handle these situations, and even
where joining, in community concern and hope, as in the old Australia Party,
later the Australian Democrats, they fall away. It is unlikely that such
unofficial groups can fulfil their promise of a non-partisan forum, without a
well-above-average commitment to the public interest by those directly involved
in its set-up and conduct. Such can never be guaranteed. <P>

Member Recall proposals for controlling nominated candidates are clearly designed to make <b><i>delegates</i></b>
of representatives, requiring a candidate to sign an undated resignation, to be
held pending use in the event of an unsatisfactory performance. Held by whom?
The point is that the Electoral Council, which would inevitably degenerate into
another local power group, would hold the letter of resignation. It has been
also described as, 'removal of parliamentarians and public officials by
petition for referendum'. It is often said by some of the proponents that the
so-called Independent would be no more than a 'messenger'. Exemplary conduct
and public responsibility of those active in the Council would be essential to
its acceptability. It all sounds decidedly risky, even where the original
concept is initiated in good faith.

<P>There has to be a better way to create non-partisan electoral forum. Fortunately there is.
