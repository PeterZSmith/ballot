<p>We are aware that conflict is the primary cause of the massive problems   in many, but especially developing countries. We are told that politics is the art of settling disputes without war, and we know that the best solution is democracy. But the principle of mutual respect, an essential characteristic of democracy, is discarded in favour of aggressive, often 
arrogant <i>leadership</i>. <br><br> 
<A NAME="America"></A>
<center>  <b>America! America!    </b><br>   
 </center><br> 
 
 So, the leading democracy in the world has stuffed up!<p>
 With a voter turnout of around fifty percent, and no resolution of the antiquated voting sytem's choice of president, the world's most powerful democracy churns on through the ocean at full speed with no hand on the wheel. (And the red button unattended.)
Three factors bear on this far from tolerable outcome.<p>
1. Voluntary Voting.<br>
We know that there is interest in America in the so-called 'compulsory vote', which we, apart from such troglodytes as Senator Nick Minchin, enjoy in Australia. <br>
Compulsory attendance at the poll requires every citizen to exercise that minimum democratic responsibility, the aim of which is the enhancement of national unity among all citizens, equal before the law.<p>


2. First Passed the Post.<br>
 This antique voting system usually means winning with well under 50% of the votes cast. The Australian preferential voting system  means that the winning candidate always has over 50% of the votes cast, by counting preferences for other candidates as well as the first choice. <br>
In the present impasse in the USA, the votes of the minor candidates, particularly those of Nader, (whose second preference votes under a preferential system would have settled the election days ago, with complete certainty) are lost, and the uncertainty lingers on, to the chagrin of America, and the bemusement of the world.<p>

 3. Winner takes All.<br> 
The winning candidate in each American state is, in most cases, granted the total number of 'electors' allocated to that state. These all then, appointed by the winning candidate,  exercise those votes at the 'electors college'.  One wonders if they do, in fact, ever actually go there. A truly quaint system - a provision now two centuries old. <p>


	The impeaching of President Clinton by the US Congress and the reaction of the public points up the acute dilemma of lovers of democracy.<br>
On the one hand there is the stand on 'principle' of the Republican Party,  that Clinton should pay the full price for his conduct.  The attack on Clinton is therefore sustainable in the face of 72% opposition by the public, because the party system of 'representative' democracy concedes full power to the parliament's majority party to ignore public opinion, albeit at their risk in the longer term.<br><br>
Alternative systems canvassed on this page would curtail parliamentary power to do just this. Citizen Initiated Referenda would strongly hinder  any dominant political power going  far from public opinion on any issue. No wonder it's hard to achieve this reform.<br><br>
 Similarly, secret ballots in parliament would prevent the growth of a power base in parliament able to ignore public opinion. When will the public wake up and demand democracy!<br><br>
The problem comes down to this - when is the minority right; when the majority? In the long run is America better off to strongly uphold 'moral'  values (for its own people, and for its world standing as defender of democracy), or is it more right to be more subject to public opinion; quite a dilemma!<br><br>
In like manner is there some greater long term community benefit from the Kennett government's stomping on local governments' planning authority, to implement its grand schemes?   Would a return to feudalism be a good idea???!!!<br><br>
 A genuine democracy would give parliamentary government scope to do much more good by heeding, and leading, public opinion. Both aspects are equally important.  But that means freeing the channels of communication between elected government and the public. Something that party governments have no interest in doing. They pre
                fer the minority power the party system gives.<br><br>
The point is, where people do not have significant power (to address perceived wrongs) community responsibility  lapses, with a corresponding decline in community morale and goodwill. Our system develops a self-centred community with  increased political apathy and cynicism <P>

  <b> Bangladesh </b> <P>
 With 2/3rds of Bangladesh underwater, millions are homeless, at best.
 (Source: returned Baptist missionary.) Do we as a nation care?  I would suggest that Australia send an urgent, composite team with substantial resources to assist, as the least we can do, as a nation with relative plen  <br><br> In the light of their sufferings, the  funds  presently devoted to political campaigning, at government expense, among other things, could be more usefully employed.
<br>  In so many cases countries have failed to get wise to the dangers of de-afforestation, with IMF and other financial pressures forcing mountain logging; with disastrous long-term effects. <br></td>
 <br><br><br>If our own politics is so strife-torn and shortsighted we can hardly blame developing countries for messing it up.  <br>In the case of Bangladesh, the longer term troubles have led to silting up of the lower reaches of the Ganges and, currently, high tides have combined with heavy rains to exacerbate their already horrendous problems.

<P><B>Brazil</B>     
<P> In  his  recent  TV <I>Postcard from  Rio</I>,  Clive  James  commented 
on  the  political scene, with the  rich  living  high  behind high walls with
their dobermans, and the  poor,  attracted  to Rio by the 'bright lights',
living in shanties on a   hillside   of  mud.  Those in government don't know
what to do, so  they  do  nothing. The intelligentsia  know what should be done,
but  can't  figure out how to get the government to do it. A typical picture  of
a failed democracy.
 
 <p>

Much is talked about the disaster of Tianenmen Square.  But the roots of the disaster lay in the fact that the protesters were against the status quo, but had no 'reasonable' plan for reform.  At one time the leaders  were actually talking to the hunger strikers in hospital! But what was their demand? "Resign"! Sorry, but there's no way that kind of protest can succeed  that easily.  <br>


In Rumania  there was a similar lack. The (young) revolutionaries, once they were successful, were in a dilemma, with no clear plan for the way forward. Older powers then  resumed control.<br>
Revolutions, when  replacing one authority with another,  can  only minimise the trauma of change if the contrast between the moral character  of the old and new authorities is stark. The Philippines is an example. <p>

 A mere strong exercise of leadership, of itself, does not make an urgent need.  With regard to Singapore, perhaps there  has been a degree of moral character in the leadership which has sustained its success.   To them, their course is 'right'.<br> 

Sometimes some suggest a benevolent dictatorship. Dictators are common but benevolence is rare. We  see  strong leadership here too, but  by all means let's study the character! Is there benevolence to match the power?    


<p><b><A NAME="Fiji"> </A> </b>
 
 <b>Fiji. Another blow to Democracy!  </b> <br><BR>
The violent  grab for power by thirty armed men in Fiji damages further our hopes for advance of democracy in the fragile politics of the Pacific.<br>

The failure of the Grand Council of Chiefs to protect the elected government - and the Constitution - dashes worldwide hopes for an orderly outcome.<p>
The dismal future of the minority Indian population is underlined by the spate of arson which has already occurred. It is clear that this failure of  the Council to defend the Constitution in the face of the threat to murder the Prime Minister and members of the government spells a new era of hopelessness for unity of the population.<p>
When democracy is so casually swept aside there can only be injustice and pain, accompanied by unresolved economic problems. The world is once more nonplussed by this setback to the wellbeing of yet another country. 
<br><br>
 
 Douglas Henry comments on Fiji .
 <P>It is true that Fiji, like many another country,  can show us a thing or two  in culture and way of life. Democracy, imperfect though it be, has been imparted from the West to many countries. Why? Because it is the very best means of government at minimising conflict.<p>
Fijian loyalty and respect for tribal authority is beyond criticism. We  should note the strenuous efforts of the Council of Chiefs, and the President, to protect the democratic Constitution and government.
So what is wrong?<p>
In every country there is conflict between the strong and the weak, the 'haves' and the 'havenots', with varying degrees of severity.  To accept George Speight's answer to Fijian concerns is to approve the  conduct of the Third Reich.<p>
 But the clumsy 'democracy' of faction and party power, common in parliaments, often fosters conflicts which are only resolvable in struggling countries, by dictatorial power. Such is Fiji's dilemma. Whenever such power has to be relied upon, one hopes and prays that the 'dictator' will be benevolent. We now look, in faith, to Rabuka.<p>
 Democracy, as Churchill said, is the worst kind of government, except for all the others. Democracy promotes equality and mutual respect, that is its essential virtue. But it  is often perverted by the insincerity of its participants to its principles; the domination of government by powerful interests - parties.<p>
There is one cure for that, and only one; when parliaments become committed,  by public demand, to vote secretly on every issue.  


More than a month has passed, but George Speight still toys with his country's future - with his vacillating demands and his unrelinquished personal ambition.<br>
Are they still singing hymns? Perhaps someione should nention to him and his gun-toting henchmen that violence threats, threats and murder have no place in the Christian tradition.<br>
And acquiring the sugar plantations created by others, by force and political manouvering, is robbery, pure and simple. The real answer to envy is economic application.<br> 
We trust that the patience of the military commander will be respected and rewarded with a successful outcome yet.<br><br>
<A NAME="Hong Kong"></A> 
   <B> Hong Kong  </B>
<P>In the TV series 'The Last Governor', it is understood that a view of the
Hong Kong Legislative Council prior to 30th June, showed the members voting by
electronic buttons with a simple screen indicating the total of Yes and No
votes.  
<P>If this system is  devoid of  a record of votes then it is typical of the
system long advocated by this page (and the book 'A Chariot of Fire'). The
notion of a parliament operating by secret ballot has been described as '<I>pure
</I>democracy'. Although no human system can be infallibly pure, the operation
of the secret electronic ballot in  a parliament can purify voting of members
from the taint of intimidation or corruptibility. 
<P>Whatever the status of Council decisions under China's two systems will be,
it is to be devoutly hoped that this Chamber may continuee to be able to operate
in this fashion even if the viewpoint of the Council is advisory only. At least
in that case genuine Hong Kong residents' viewpoint can be  known. Confusion of
developing countries' ideas of the nature of democracy has been caused by the
practise of demonstrations and confrontation which has been observable in
'Western' societies. It should be realised that the 'heat' seen in these
situstions is caused by the strangled nature of Western political systems
because of the unrepresentative nature of our systems. Corrupted by parties and
other  power groups,  our parliaments have failed in the duty of demonstrating
<I>export-quality</I> democracy. 
<P>In the view of this page, a parliament having this kind of facility for 
directly reflecting the views of the populace through the free representation of
Representives in Parliament, will  obviate  the need for people to 'let off
steam' in public demonstrations, as each representative would then be
independent of othewr pressures and responsible to be a conduit for community
concerns to the governing body.                            
<A NAME="hungary"></A>
<P><B>Hungary</B>  -  <B> TV Power !  </B>        
<P> An  interesting  report  surfaced  in  <I>Time  
</I>magazine   some   time  ago  with regard  to Hungary. In the grip of 
Communism  at the time, the report was  the more startling.5         
<P> In   a  TV  programme, called '66', it  was  reported,  the  compere  had  
invited an audience of 66  people,  selected  from  correspondents  to  the
channel;  it  may have  been   the   only  one!. A Member of the Government  was
 also  invited  to speak to  the people.         
<P>It  was  brought out in the article that this was no  ordinary   meeting   
where  the 'peasants'  were told what was   good   for  them. The members of 
the  audience  themselves were  essentially  in  control  of  the meeting; so
much   so   that  the   visiting   government   representative   could be given
a hard time   -   by   the audience!        
<P> This  was  plainly illustrated by the case of a woman  in  the  audience, 
a   farm  labourer,   who  refused   to   be  silenced   until   the  
government  representative promised action  on  her  complaint; the promise
being subsequently fulfilled.         
<P>The  secret  of the power of the audience was said to  be  the  presence on
each seat of an electronic secret voting device. This  enabled the audience as a
whole to express their opinions   about  the government (and, no doubt, the
Representative),  quite  freely,  and so shatter any attempt by officials on 
the  platform  to  override the audience. 
 <P> It is puzzling that our television   interviewers don't want to  follow  it
up. For some inexplicable reason our television people  apparently    prefer  
the  present weak  methods; relying   on   their   own  personalities, and often
failing  to   bring    recalcitrant   politicians to book during an interview.  
 In  addition,  the  views of the  audience  cannot be sufficiently  presented; 
  and  the members are deprived  of  a    very   interesting   and  powerful
supporting  role for the  interviewer. Consequently  the  treatment of 
controversial  matters and personalities  is  often weak and inconclusive.

<P><B><A NAME="Indonesia">Indonesia</A></B><P>
The leaders of both sides agree that blame for the violence can be traced to a campaign two years ago by rival politicians, one Muslim, the other Christian, for the position of town mayor, or bupati. The politicians bankrolled groups of supporters who ended up attacking each other. The terrible things that have happened in the past few weeks have been acts of revenge.<br>
"The problem was political, at first," a conservative Muslim leader, Yahya al - Amri, said. "But it developed into a religious conflict. People with money and power are responsible."  </blockquote>

<p><b> <A NAME="Ireland">Ireland</A> </b>
 <p>
 The recent successes of the Irish economy were highlighted in the

<P><B><A NAME="israel">Israel</A></B>     
<P> The   indecisiveness  of multi-party politics, based  on  a   single  
country-wide  electorate  with  voting  by  proportional  representation,  is
crippling Israel's ability to come  to  grips  with problems which cannot be
avoided.  Only the   implementation  of the secret ballot in parliament can
enable sensible,  majority   decisions to emerge freely on the severe problems
she is facing.                                  
<P><B><A NAME="lebanon">Lebanon</A></B>      
<P> As  noted  earlier, Mr. Sarkis, when President of  Lebanon,    commented 
that  their  problem was the problem   of  minorities;    injustice  and the 
fear of  it being the cause.   And  fear,  as  well as past injustice,  leads 
to  hatred.          
<P> Only   trust  can  generate  an environment  of   cooperation;   and  trust
can only  develop   where there is a valid  basis  for  it. The trust of the
governed requires a manifestly fair  politi- cal   system  giving   equal 
opportunity  to  be  heard  and  an   evident  care   for  all by  those  who
have   been   given   the  privilege  and responsibility of government.  How 
often we  hear  the cry for a political solution! Is it so impossible to see? <p>
<A NAME="Malaysia"></A>
<b>Malaysia </b>   <br><br> 
 Al Gore's succinct comment on the Malaysian economic/political situation was pretty much on the ball. <br>
In saying that economic reform was insufficient without political reform towards a real democracy he said no more than the truth. To class his comments as 'not nice' - 'bad manners', as the  Malaysia Minister did,  could  not, in any way refute the truth he so clearly stated. <br><br>
Real progress, in any country, is impossible without the real cooperation of the people. To the extent that there are under currents of distress, tension, and any sense of injustice, the public life of the country is  depressed  and the real  potential of the people  is depleted. <br><br>

The real difficulty for Asian peoples, struggling towards a real democracy,
is that Western democracies are so faulty that they provide no simple way forward.  
With rigid systems of flawed election processes and fixed government, reliance is routinely placed on demonstrations, of escalating violence, to attempt resolution of  problems which governments want to ignore.<br><br>
Is it any wonder then that the  very serious problems which  are faced in this region are causing such political and social havoc?<br><br>
Genuine democracy is a refined process of reaching the best solutions for the people with calm. How little effort has been put into cleansing our own system.<br><br>
Prime Minister Howard's  sympathy for Malaysia's leadership in its 'difficult political situation' rings a little odd. What about the pain of the people?<br><br>
Above all we, who pretend to  democracy  need to think about our responsibility to give a real example of how Asian peoples  could proceed  peacefully and successfully to the change they need.<br> 
We, in the West, have failed them.<br><br>

	                            
<P><B><A NAME="newguinea">New Guinea</A></B>      
<P> Rising  quickly  from a primitive culture, New Guinea   has   different  
problems.  Without  the dominance of ideologies,  the  Members  of   the  New
Guinea   Parliament are  absorbed  by  the  preeminence  of  local interests,
and alive  to   the   available   gains  from  power. They are therefore apt  to
extend their  sup port  to the  party  able   to   win government   by  
coalition,   and thereby be granted favours   for  their   districts. With the 
constant  threat of  Members  changing their  support from   Gov ernment  to  
Opposition,  the  possibility  of  censure  motions  poses a  continual  threat 
to stability.          
<P> It has been suggested that the stability of a two party system  (with 
ideological  loyalties) would be better for New  Guinea  -  like trading in a
car on a 'lemon'!        
<P> Whether  we look at the 'wheeling  and dealing'  of individual  Members  in
New Guinea, or at the more permanent deals of politicians  with  their parties
in Australia , we are looking  at  the  sale of votes for advantage.         
<P>Votes   have   power,  and the open vote is a commodity  which  can be used
for bargaining.   The secret  vote  is not. The  open  vote is  'saleable'
because it  can permit  an  accumulation  of  power.        
<P> Clearly  the  secret ballot removes the 'saleability'  of  the  vote, and
the  opportunity for the excessive power of the  shift ing votes of the Members. 
        
<P> As   to  stability,  with the secret ballot in  vogue  in  any  parliament,
 all   decisions  will be made by the majority  votes  of  the whole parliament
on each issue,  and  Ministers  will  be  subservient to  the Parliament. It
follows that there is then  no   party  or coalition government   to unseat, and
the  only  useful  function  of  the  vote is  to  support  that which is  sane 
and  sensible, and with  which the Member's electorate will be happy.        
<P> On  the other hand, any Member can raise a matter of  electorate   
concern, and  can expect, with the secret ballot, that  the  other  Members will
 permit  its passage  if it is fair and  reasonable.   There is thus a rational
way for   legitimate  concerns   to   be met, but no way to manipulate the
system to  gain   illegitimate  demands.       
<P>  It   is  considered that a secret ballot procedure  in   their  
Parliament  would materially  assist  New Guinea to progress to a  calmer 
political   process  and  a more  stable  and  successful  economy.<P>
 
  <A NAME="Northern Ireland"></A>
  <br><br><B>Northern Ireland.</B><P>
  Britain has been failing the people of  Northern Ireland   
 in not providing a democratic solution, and lacking
the moral authority to rule out political confrontation. 
<P>A blackout of the  feeble light of democracy  is now threatening the existence of the NI Assembly. The IRA, being  a law unto itself,  has no intention of permanently disposing of its armaments. The assembly has no power to enforce and a breakdown may well see its suspension. Should this likely result occur, one might well ask: “Where now?”<br>
Some years ago,  a suggestion was put forward to the British (then Thatcher) government that a truly democratic parliament alone could resolve the Northern Ireland question. The proposal was for a progressive transfer of power from Westminster to a Stormont Assembly on a ‘prove you can do it ‘ basis.<br>
A new kind of parliament in Stormont was proposed, based on a  change from the normal open voting (in parliament) to  electronic secret ballots for all decisions, (including the election of Ministers by the Members of the parliament). <br> 
Clearly this would usher in a new  kind  of democracy altogether, clearing the way for sound and fair, strong government.<br>
It is obvious that the vast majority of the people of Northern Ireland want peace, which is only possible with good, and therefore strong,  government.   But this can only be provided by a parliament  that can have the confidence of the people that sound decisions will be reached on an objective basis. Only the ongoing controlling influence of the ballot can promote that climate. And as that climate of confidence in its objective decision-making progresses so could the Assembly advance towards the
assumption of  full power.<p>
A further important factor is the fear in the North of a Protestant minority situation which would occur under any move to unification, which is the understandable desire of the South.<br>
Could it be? Well, consider.<br>
 If the North could establish  sound (objective non-sectarian)  
government   on the above basis, could not Ireland advance to union on a
similar basis; to the mutual advantage of all. <br> 
The  problem has  defeated the standard approach - party/sectarian political -  for many years, and a much better style of democracy  alone can  gain the necessary confidence of  the conflicting interests and the people generally. <br>
In the last analysis, only the latter can generate the strength  and integrity of government needed to quiet the conflict.<p>
The Prime Minister, Great Britain. 23/7/97. 
<P>Dear Sir, 
<P>Some years ago a letter was sent to Mrs. Margaret Thatcher,
then Prime Minister. It concerned the well recognised need for a political
solution to the sectarian problems of Northern Ireland. It is quite plain
that a political solution must be based in some way on a new style of parliamentary democracy to overcome the existing sectarian bias and prejudice. 
<P>To thus succeed it is apparent that the parliament (i.e. a refreshed Stormont) must be peopled by representatives who have the integrity
and freedom to move into the area of objective decision-making which bypasses the sectarian pressures which have so far defeated all efforts to procure peaceful coexistence there. 
<P>A way is needed to set community-selected representatives
free to operate on a conscience basis. They must be enabled to be true
representatives, responsive to the concerns of the community, but not as
delegates, subject to community opinion and pressures. 
<P>A new way is required. The suggestion to Mrs. Thatcher
was that Stormont should be recreated, initially as a body advising the
British government, then with limited administrative powers, with the clear
purpose and plan of expansion as the new system 'works'. 
<P>To be successful such a system would need:
<BR>1. A substantial number of single member electorates
to give clear representation. (The Australian preferential system seems
to have advantages; but optional preference would be better.) 
<BR>2. All issues would be decided in Stormont by secret ballot - a simple electronic voting system would not be costly - it would have no memory for voting records.
<BR>3. Ministers would all be individually elected by ballot and would be actually responsible to the parliament for carrying out the decisions of the parliament.
<P>An extension, far more radical, could be considered. Women could play a major role in the resolution of the problem if given the power. With this in mind, voting papers could be (initially), sex distinctive.
Women's' votes could then be given a differential weight. Or, the vote
could be confined, in the beginning, to women! 
 
<p> This basis could create a new trust in the political process due to the resulting objectivity and justice of a parliament of this nature. 


<p>The outcome of the election (91% in the South, 75% in the North) tells its own story.  The weight given to unification is plain. But  can the majority Protestants be confident?  What will be the trend of feeling after the euphoria? With the clear  acceptance  of the idea of unification by the British government, the 75% enthusiasm for a settlement of the troubles may well shrink rapidly in the North.<p>

 There is to be a new parliament in Stormont. What form will it take?
 Merely recreating a typical parliament, with  the same groups struggling against each other along partisan lines, will give no stimulus to confidence.  <p>Causes for fear  can  be resolved only by a new style of politics in which conscience can have at least <i>some</i> chance to prevail over partisan attitudes and loyalties. The need is for the <b>secret ballot in the new parliament </b> so that at least some representatives can  start a new trend, by deciding objectively issues of concern to groups they would not normally be expected to support. It is quite ridiculous to suppose, as some do, that   'moderates' who supported the peace initiative would not give such objective consideration to the concerns  of others.<p>
Without  such a new  political climate  the  settlement is basically rotten, and it will take little to tip over the fragile balance of the agreement. It should be noted that the IRA has no intention of decommissioning their arms. One or two incidents  could easily demolish the whole thing.  <br>


<p>The comments of Tony Blair and Gerry Adams  have included a note of caution, but the agreement reached in Belfast is certainly a major milestone in the  history of this bedeviled country. Considerable praise is due to all who have taken part. <p>  
  In  previous letters (initially to Margaret Thatcher)   it was proposed that   the British government should  create a new  parliament  in Stormont, with the freedom of Members to vote secretly on all
issues; (including the election of ministers) - to  give  freedom for all MPs to support any reasonable claims from whatever quarter;  and to enable more realistic local representation.<p> 
 A new frontier in democratic thinking and practice could break the entrenched  powers of extreme elements; short circuiting delays in this important process. A bold move could make all the difference at this crucial time.<p> 
  When  it is perceived that conscience voting in Stormont  can  produce equitable decisions, public confidence can build and replace the concerns, fears, and  bitter antagonisms of the past.
<p>
The present fruitfulness of the effort for peace in Northern Ireland deserves every chance of success.  Congratulations to all concerned!   
<p>Update 5/5/98. But the strains are telling. The IRA won't disarm, and some extreme Protestants are afraid to accept the proposals.
<p>It was always apparent that the  republicans were intent on unification and the English bent on getting out. The proposals thinly disguise these aims only. Only a non-partisan style of parliament in Stormont (in a genuine, mainfestly democratic format) can make progress  to  develop over a period the trust and confidence in a political process which can remove the sense of injustice  and  liquidate the mutual distrust and anger in the divided north.  Without parliamentary  government of that calibre peace in the north,  or unification, must be a long way off. One ex Belfast man thinks 20 - 50 years is needed. We hope not, but a new dimension appears the only alternative.  <P>
<P> The  same  kind of problem exists in Ulster.  Here  a  long  history  of 
injustice  is felt by the Catholic minority  as  the  result  of  the British 
invasion  long  ago, and the  subsequent  prosperity of  the Protestant majority
in  <A><I>their</I></A>  country. It   is quite evident that the invasions of
history cannot now be  reversed.           
<P> It   is   equally  evident  that  the  celebrations of  victories  of  long
 ago  are particularly   odious   to  the  Catholic  minority.   One   would   
think   that    any   regime    really   interested  in  a  'fair go'  for  all
its  citizens  would scrap     such insensitive actions. Is it a fear of being
<I>weak</I> ?         
<P>    For    Ulster   to celebrate such things as the Battle of  the  Boyne 
must  be like waving a red rag to a bull.        
<P>    In   like   vein the bicentennial  celebrations  in  Australia    were
not, understandably, popular with  Aboriginal people.          
<P>    To  rejoice over,  aggravate,  and put down a minority is  far  from  
consistent   with  the principles of democracy.   Yet   it   must   be realised 
that fear  of  minority  groups  creates  and  perpetuates  a  fortress 
mentality; and   the   organising   and   demonstration of power is  in  reality
a primitive response to  a    perceived  threat.  To diminish  such  fears  it 
is  common  for   groups   in  power  to circumscribe opportunities for  others 
to  exercise power.       
<P>    What is the answer?         
<P>   British   governments have played 'ducks and drakes' with  the   problem 
for decades and come no nearer to a viable solution than  when  they started. 
Again and  again  one  hears  the cry for  a  political solution.          
<P>    The  only proposal with any likelihood of a successful outcome  -   an 
independent Ulster with a secret ballot parliament -  has  received no comment 
from the British government. It is true  that the Irish Republic has changed in
recent years and  such change may sufficiently diminish Protestant fears to  
enable  democratic institutions to end  recourse to violence.

 <BR><A NAME="Pakistan"><B>Pakistan.</B></A>  <P>A serious storm is brewing in Pakistan following the Prime Minister's contempt of court which has landed him in trouble with the country's High Court.<P>Amendments to the law to enable an appeal have been passed by the parliament but the President has refused to sign the amendment into law. what will happen is hard to guess but emotions are hotting up. It is a serious situation.<P>How does this affect us? <P>The matter must interest considerably. We are looking at the possibility of a republic with a president, and the nature of the presidential powers are critical to this decision. <P> 
We already have some jostling  between the Executive (Prime Minister) and the High Court which is  straying from the previous loyalty to the principle of the separation of powers. <P> Introduction of a president into the equation naturally adds some more uncertainty. But reform is required, and one would hope that we are not afraid to tackle a hard one. After all we beat the world in installing the secret ballot for elections over 120 years ago. <P>Why not complete the picture? The world can do with a fresh vision of democracy. We need to move on.<br><br>


<P><B><A NAME="Russia">Russia</A></B>
<P>Blind trust in privatisation is   not faring too well in Russia.We could compare China taking a more pragmatic approach - in progressing to  a world class economy - the Gorbachev approach??
<P>What a shambles the principle of separation of powers  is in, in a presidential 'democracy', when we see a   parliament and president with conflicting powers!<br>
Mr. Yeltsin has the ability to sack a Prime Minister (three times in the year), for failure of the economy, when the real reason is that he needed a  supporter PM to quell the drive for his impeachment.
 The rush to a free market economy, without democracy, (under presidential rule - just like America), is proving once again that economic ideology is the enemy of the people. The Duma wants to see parliamentary
government - presidential government is for dictatorships! Bring back Gorbachev! 
 <p> Perhaps the saddest thing at the moment is the ruinous nature of
the Russian mess, and Clinton's support of Yeltsin on the condition of
continuing the 'reform' process.          
<P>Political  turmoil  reigns as the confused Soviets seek  to  find  their 
way  to democracy by following the Western pattern!          
<P>The  dependence  of  the people  on  the  uncertain  abilities   and 
democratic  integrity of leaders, shows up the total  inade quacy  of
presidential, or  leader style government. With Yeltsin   absent,  Russia
flounders,  with  him present  they  are   afraid   of his dictatorial style. 
        
<P>No   sensible and  clear-cut example of  effective  people-involvement   in 
 government  is visible for them  in  the  world's  established  'democracies'.
Without a clear  democratic  goal   the   problems  are  growing instead of 
being   resolved.   With   minorities virtually  frantic  with worry and
consequent  demands  for   independence,  it  is plain that trust in centralised
 government  is virtually nil.          
<P>    Only a sound democratic system  can  engender trust in central 
government because it can reflect the reasonable wishes  of   the  people,  and 
diminish  the powers of  leaders  to  ignore  them.   Unless  majority  rule is
secured, majority  fear  of  minorities  cannot  be  defused, and minority needs
and  concerns  addressed.  Then only can a political entity survive.         
 
<P> In  the present time  of  economic  turmoil, the    need   for  trust in
the emerging political system is  of  paramount   importance.   But,  as with
the revolution in  Rumania,  the  confusion  resulting  from  the absence of an
evidently sane  and  effective  style of democratic government to emulate, can 
easily  result in  a  slide  back to substantially the same situation  that 
existed  before.        
<P>    A further coup is also feared. Where power and clear direction  are  
lacking there  is  a  vacuum which cannot  continue.  Their  need for  a  new 
democratic vision  to  forestall  the   assumption  of  powers  by 
non-democrats  is  urgent.        
<P>    Meanwhile  a  new  term has been invented - 'Russian  Paralysis'  -  
for  the terrible stalemate that  results  from  the  attempt  to resolve
critical problems with the  kind  of  ridiculously   archaic  political systems
which   we   honour,   without  rhyme or reason, with the name of Western
democracy - especially the presidential type.<p>
  
What a shambles the principle of separation of powers produces in a country when achieved though a parliament and president with conflicting powers!<br>
Mr. Yeltsin has the ability to sack a Prime Minister (three times in the year),
for failure of the economy, when the real reason is that he needs a  supporter PM to quell the drive for his impeachment.<br>
What a hopeless system. 
 Viva la Parliamentary government <b>!</b>  <br><br>

<P><B><A NAME="srilanka">Shri Lanka</A></B>    
<P>      The damage  of  past  conflict and ethnic tensions can    only   be
undone  by  providing  a  tangible  basis  for the  resolution   of  the   
basic    problems  in  a manner which  gives   grounds   for trust to be
restored.        
<P> Once again the balloting parliament is the way with a  realistic   hope. 
For all minorities, loss of trust can  only  lead  to  disintegration.  Only  a 
real  democracy  can   restore   trust.  Without that, unity can never be
regained.         
<P> The  problem  is that for many, the 'democracy' they have seen  is  thought
to be the only way  it can  be. Only by moving  to  a  real  democracy  can a
revived process of  politics  resolve  the  problems, and deal with  the
distrust which has lead to the  fear  and hatred,  violence and civil war.   
                                                              
<P><B><A NAME="sweden">
Sweden</A></B>          
<P> A  visitor from Sweden spoke, during an  election  campaign  here, of a
crisis in  government in his country. In his  opinion,  Australia seems to be 
going  the same way.        
<P> The   main   problems,  he claimed, stemmed from   the   party    system.  
He commented  that they are   eternally  fighting  each  other, intent on  their
 own advantage,  instead  of  thinking of  what  is good for the  country  as  a
 whole. Moreover  there  is  no  real stability,  as  a  change  of  government 
produces    a   complete    change    of    policies,  and that  is  the  end 
of   continuity  and  confidence.         
<P> A  large public company, he agreed, if run in  this   fashion,   would soon
 be in liquidation! <P>                                    
 
  
  
 
<P><B>The World</B>      
<P> The  world is in a mess. Will we, who have an answer,  continue  to fiddle? 
      
<P>   Within  one generation there will be many changes and  adjustments  
facing  us, as a more involved  and  strengthening  United   Nations  
intervenes increasingly in the affairs  of  'sovereign'  nations.  The  world 
is shrinking fast, and  in  the  course  of   time,   many  questions will no
longer be ours to   decide.   Our  future eventually  will be in the hands of
the world majority.       
<P>    The  world needs to urgently learn a better mode of  democracy  to solve
the political problems in order to survive.       
<P>    It  has been truly said that war is the failure  of  politics.  With 
civil war everywhere, it is plain that world democracy  has  an enormous task
ahead of it. Old ways must be revised; new  must  be tackled. Retreat  into <B><I><A
NAME="fortress">Fortress Australia</A></I></B> will merely  stave  off  the
inevitable for a time; and see necessary change, which  could  be  made early by
adjustment with less trauma, forced upon us  by  cataclysm.                  
  
<P> In a troubled world we, here,  need to urgently find, and show  forth, a
much healthier and more effective democracy.
