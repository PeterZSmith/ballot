 <h2>Big Parties, Big Money</h2><br />
 In a scathing article, (The Age Monday 25/7/05, p13, get it and read it) Dr. Graeme Orr of Griffith University and J00-Cheong Tham, of Liberty Victoria, claim that our democratic system has been sidetracked by big money infecting the party system. Lop-sided party wealth, from donations, advantages by incumbency etc mean that the major parties have a considerable advantage (like five times) over anyone else, when measured as an amount per primary vote.<br /><br />
 We well know that the major parties have box seats in parliament, with the absence of a 'level playing field'. Orr and Tham are certainly right in their claim that: ... our political system 'is democratic in name only'. And that's the truth despite much rhetoric about 'our democracy'. <br /><br />
 'The truth will set you free' said Jesus. Yes always, in any context, <em>if we act on it</em>, for truth highlights problems and also points to their solution.<br /><br />
 We need radical political reform through secret ballots <em>within</em> our parliaments, to recreate parliamentary government, real electorate representation, real parliamentary debate, and each executive unarguably responsible to its parliament.<br />
