 <H2>Conclusion</H2>
<h3>Whither Australia?</h3> 

We can be, by far, the most politically stable country in the world if we want to be-with extraordinary benefits to all. We just need to recognise the outstanding contribution of our secret ballot's civilising effect on the conduct of elections, and apply it to the operations of our parliaments. We got it together once, in 1856, with the 'Australian' ballot. Let's do it again-in our parliaments-with an Australian democracy.<br /><br />

Establishing true democratic government in our own country could well turn the tide internationally. Lech Walesa, Polish hero who turned Poland from Communism, says the world is 'lopsided' and needs new direction. He sees Australia as having a unique role to play and urges us to 'tip the balance'<a href="notes8.htm">1</a>. The world needs democratic government and that must be through a revitalisation of the United Nations to be able to rule in the world with equity. The world is waiting-in pain.<br /><br />

We have a dream of democratic government-without the artificial conflict of party and factional politics. Our task is to convert that dream into reality.<br /><br />

It is said that people fall into three categories. Those people who make things happen-those who watch things happen-and those to whom things just happen. Which are we going to be? The world <br /><br />

In many cases the help that more fortunate nations give to the less fortunate ones is not the real answer to their problems. Real democratic government, giving justice and internal order, the true basis of freedom, is the world's primary need; so the people can rise out of the bondage of autocracy and poverty.<br /><br />

Instead, we see tragic turmoil throughout the world today, with enmity and armed conflict between ethnic and religious groups as the world fragments. Only real democracy can achieve the good government they so much need, to stem the tide of distrust and fear; and the suffering caused by war and starvation, in so many places.<br /><br />

The world needs a model to follow, an example of a valid, viable democracy, free of the endemic cancer of party politics, so pervasive in existing examples of 'democracy'. The world suffers while it waits. Only a steady reform of the world's democratic systems can give a real hope for the future. At present it is simply the 'blind leading the blind'.<br /><br />

There is no reason why Australia cannot provide the example of a breakthrough to a far more just and effective democracy. The secret ballot IN parliament is the way. A secret ballot parliament will far outshine any party system, be it a one, two, three or multiparty system. It will open the door wide to a new quality of unifying self-government, which can yield better justice, and better freedoms than any bill of rights can confer. Serious problems will become tractable as a strongly cooperating society, stimulated by the new political freedom, produces the initiative, and the will, necessary for their resolution. This new style of democratic government will enable many new frontiers to be opened, providing a wide range of freedoms in many new spheres of human endeavour: in many countries.<br /><br />

<h3>The frontier</h3> 
The concept of real freedom is associated with the idea of a 'frontier'-a place where new things are happening, a place of courage and adventure, where new opportunities are opening up for the release of pent-up creative energy, the release of powerful forces from the straitjacket of the exhausting and exhausted status quo, the possibility, the challenge, and the soul stimulating freedom of breaking new ground.<br /><br />

We think of the early achievements of man: the invention of the wheel, of written language, ancient civilisations, Athenian democracy, the Renaissance, the sailing ship, the New World, the steam engine, the railroad, the internal combustion engine, the motor vehicle, the aeroplane, the jet engine, antibiotics, the computer, the silicon chip and the PC, man on the moon, space exploration, the Internet, organ transplants, and mobile phones.<br /><br />

All these achievements have been instrumental in transporting mankind into new realms of power and potential to do things never done before, enabling the fulfilment of man's creative energy and spirit of adventure, releasing him from the rut of the already known into the freedom of the unknown and the untried.<br /><br />

Human activity is the normal manifestation of life, where there is freedom. Through our restless energy, problems are constantly being solved; new things are being done-wherever there is a real freedom for individuals to follow their dream. We may suffer many setbacks through our own incapacity, through natural events, or through bad health-that's life. Man constantly demonstrates the victorious spirit in the face of natural disasters. 'What cannot be cured must be endured' is the philosophical reply to natural disaster. However, a lack of freedom caused by man destroys the soul of man.
<br /><br />
How free are we? Are we free in some ways, but perhaps, not in other ways? What about the future? Will we be free? Will we have the freedom to think, to express new and life-changing thoughts, and convert them into action, in our various environments? Will we be free to follow our dream?
<br /><br />
In our personal lives faith sets us free. In home and family, love makes us free. In our work environment the integrity of honest endeavour gives us freedom; expanding our opportunities. In the wider community we have 'democracy', the genius and intent of which is to maximise our freedom, through responsible government, in the hands of the people. Without that we cannot be truly free to lead productive lives, with wellbeing. We cannot afford the degeneracy of democracy that hinders the legitimate freedom and creative potential of all of us, denying us the natural enlargement of life and opportunity for which our humanity yearns. The stern discipline of the secret ballot in our parliaments is the way to enable a true government, of the people, by the people, and for the people, to come to pass. This is the essential for sound and just government, enhancing the reputation of our representatives and our parliaments, and our freedom.<br /><br />

For all concerned people the opportunity to be part of the 'solution' can be realised at last. In this way, there can be an open opportunity for people in any walk of life to initiate action with new ideas in respect of any of the many issues that can and will confront us. All who wish, will have the same unfettered opportunity to enter at will into the widened arena of realistic, effective debate-a single comprehensive process of non-partisan political activity and self-government.
<br /><br />
Those with no desire for real democracy will cry: 'Chaos', as their counterparts did in 1856, when the secret ballot for elections was first adopted in Victoria, Australia.<a href="notes8.htm">2</a> The absolute contrary was true then, and it will be proved true again. Any disbelievers and critics could save themselves later embarrassment if they just hold their fire, for the best objectives of all people will be much more effectively and securely achieved under this new system of cooperative self-government. The secret ballot IN our parliaments is the final step to a real democracy.<br /><br />

Was it Churchill who said, 'Give us the tools and we will finish the job'?
<br /><br />
This is the tool we now need, to breath into our democracy the unknown and unsuspected freedom and dynamic power of the Secret Ballot in our parliaments.<br /><br />
