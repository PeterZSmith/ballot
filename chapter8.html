<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU>In the <i>Couchman over Australia</i> programme on the subject of an
Australian republic some years ago, one young fellow made an eloquent case for
a republic, as being a way to unite all Australians in a forward looking, truly
Australian identity - perhaps not a bad thought; (and, incidentally, a fine
example of the kind of leadership we need - 'persuasive leadership' without
decisive power; along the lines previously discussed). </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU>Whatever form we may consider suited to this country's future needs,
the most important aspect is to achieve the ability, for our political system
to provide unifying and creative leadership for the broad spectrum of
Australian society, including the diverse interests and concerns of the States;
and not forgetting the Aborigines and other ethnic and minority groups. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU>A mere change from a formal monarchy to a typical republic has no
chance of resolving the country's problems with peace and goodwill. Clearly
there is work to do, to have a uniquely Australian solution - one that will
enhance democratic government and be seen by people generally as sound,
incorporating the best principles of democracy. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>There has been minority interest
in a republic for a long time. But various factors have provided the impetus in
recent years. Previous to World War Two there were strong connections with the
UK, including trade and defence ties. Since then Australia's interests have
centred more around the Pacific. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>The 1901 Constitution retained the
full authority of the Crown through 'the reserve powers', Australia being then
subservient to the Crown; as the Constitution still states. But the Crown's
authority has been whittled away by UK and Australian enactments to nothing,
leaving the Governor General (and state Governors) still able, in theory at
least, to exercise the reserve powers of the Crown in accordance with the
outdated Constitution. These powers have now been gradually restrained by
convention. In 1975 the 'reserve powers' of the Crown were used by the Governor
general, Sir John Kerr to dismiss the Whitlam government, the incident
highlighting the now antiquated Constitutional provisions, which previously
bound Australia, as a UK colony. The conflict between the Senate and the House
of Representatives was the basic problem that triggered the dismissal. It was,
and is, a separate issue - i.e. how to resolve such conflict without reference
to the Governor General (or, for that matter, a President). That conflict was a
catalyst for a new and greater interest in Australia's diminished relationship
to the Crown. Thus we have two Constitutional problems that require solution,
some being more interested in one problem, some in the other, and some who
don't want to solve either! </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>The 1995 (20th) anniversary of
'the dismissal' produced its sheaf of literature on the event, with little
clear-cut idea how to resolve the basic conflict between the two Houses of
Parliament. Preferred suggestions reflect partisan positions. Gough Whitlam
called for fixed terms, the Democrats want entrenchment of proportional
representation in the Constitution to ensure their role in the Senate, and the
Coalition wanted no change, claiming the Senate to be 'representative' - until
recently, after losing its earlier control of the Senate. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Unlike the United Kingdom,
Australia is not a unitary state, but a federation of states, governed by the
Constitution, with the constitutional powers conferred on the Senate creating
the possibility of conflict between the two Houses of Parliament. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>The necessity for, and the origin
of the Senate's power was the uniting of the separate colonies at Federation.
The separate states thus joined had to be given confidence that their interests
would not be swallowed up in the new Federal government. That worry is still
about. In 1901 this problem was resolved by establishing the Senate with the
same number of representatives for each state, regardless of population, and
giving the Senate some restrictive powers over the House of Representatives -
especially the power to withhold 'Supply' (of finance for the operation of
government). </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Solution of these problems is
important. We need to amend the Constitution to remove the anomalous 'reserve
powers' of the Crown whether we move to a republic or not. But we do need to
resolve the difficulties of the relationship between the two Houses of
Parliament in a simple but effective way. Majority rule is the essential basis
of democratic decision-making, but the split of the decision-making into two
Houses, while considered necessary to protect the smaller states, has created
ongoing angst. (By contrast the House of Commons has unfettered political
power; derived from the people by election.) </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>If the powers of the Head-of-State
can be designed to keep the peace, so to speak, between the two Houses where
necessary, the democratic functioning of government could be usefully improved.
There are problems. Let's fix them, whether as we are or, in the context of a
republic. And certainly, let us not just 'buy' other country&#8217;s failed systems. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>How then would we achieve a formal
republic, with changes that would better our democracy? Would a president be
more likely to challenge a prime minister? It depends on the nature of the
republic we create; a serious question. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>We are faced with important
decisions; do nothing or venture into the brave new world of change. The public
has lost a lot of confidence in government, with apathy and cynicism. The
symbolism of the change of century and the anniversary of Federation encourages
us to reconsider. The unifying link to the Crown has suffered the ravages of
time and the majority or the people seem to favour an elected president. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>While the Queen's relationship
with Australia as head of the Commonwealth of nations will doubtless be
continued in the same way it does with other member countries, whether
monarchies or republics, there is an unfilled gap in our national life which
calls for a symbolic head-of state, the role <i>once</i> inspiringly filled by
the Crown. It's up to us. Will we be clever or stupid? We can make the 'mess'
good or... we can make a good mess of it! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Some say Australia is a republic
in all but name so why mess with it. For monarchists it suggests the
pointlessness of agitating for a formal republic. But republicans counter with
the question: why not change the constitution to reflect our evolution as a de
facto republic? Complete the paperwork! The Prime Minister, Mr. Howard, claims
that our system works well, so it makes no sense to replace it with a republic.
Furthermore, he claims, our system cannot be replicated under a republic. Is it
really that good? Would we want to? Unfortunately it does not work well. That
was the reason for the dustup in 1975 - the fractious nature of party politics
combined with the bi-cameral system. There have been many drawing attention to
the real problem - the dominance of the Prime Minister and Cabinet over
parliament, but in that case it was the Opposition leader in the Senate who
kicked over the traces. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Republicans claim a national
maturity demands change. But there is a serious question whether we have the
political maturity to make sensible change. Many think an elected president
will automatically rectify the problems of the system by giving the people more
power. That could be a strong factor behind the 'elect the president' campaign.
But an elected president could become involved in disputing the executive
authority of government, becoming one more source of power and conflict;
between President, Prime Minister and Parliament. Add to that the view
expressed by members of the High Court that it might be able to reflect the
will of 'the people' better than the executive, which now dominates parliament,
subverting the individual representation of Members. This worrying claim was made
in defence of a complex ruling based on Common Law, that a parliamentary
enactment was unconstitutional. Could they have had in mind the incubus on
democratic decision-making, which the party system undoubtedly is? </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Add to that mishmash a
heavy-footed president with a mandate, based on popular election, to interfere
in politics. Is that the way to better representative government? Paul Keating
(The one who enjoyed 'pulling the levers') comments on the (possible) danger: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt'>... the pressure will grow to give Australia an elected presidency in
the future, a position that will enjoy the full reserve powers of an English
monarch (over parliament). Such a development would change forever the
political primacy of the Parliament, Prime Minister and Cabinet in our political
system.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Another warning. The tenure of an
elected head-of-state could exceed the parliamentary term, (unless there were
fixed terms for Parliament) giving a preponderant political clout to that
office. Parliament could be reduced to a role of irritated frustration, like
that of present parliamentary Oppositions. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Another argument (of the
monarchists) for no change is the beneficent effects of attachment to the
Crown, binding the whole political structure to the governing moral foundation
of God and His righteousness. This is highlighted in the coronation of the
Queen. Before the Queen could receive the sceptre of royal rule, she first must
accept the golden orb representing the earth, surmounted by the cross of Christ
the Redeemer - He who by life and death demonstrated the ultimate humility, now
honoured above all, as King of kings. Humility is the doorway to authority. The
Queen thus symbolised her acceptance that a royal ruler is subject to God -
with a responsibility to serve the people. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>To sever what remains of the
intimate ties with the monarchy will remove the contribution of the Queen to
our national life as a (once) unifying influence in the country. But mere
religious form can be worse than useless. The importance of this to people
generally was highlighted in the life of Princess Diana and even more in her
death. She had what it takes. What a pity that we did not act quickly and
extract her from the suffocating clutches of the royal family, to be Queen of
Australia! </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Does the Crown have any moral
influence today? Mr. McGarvie mentions that, while Governor of Victoria, this
aspect never entered his mind. And does the traditional regalia of barristers
improve the justice of our legal system? When traditions are purely formal they
can be valueless and the real values have to be rediscovered, more easily
perhaps without the traditional trappings. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>The principle is plain. Those who
submit to higher authority receive the right - the power - to rule. And in a
substantially secular society the ultimate authority is unquestionably the
people. And we may well reflect that God is not a remote figment of a religious
imagination but the Spirit that moves amongst us seeking to impart His wisdom
and blessing. As Machiavelli said, 'the voice of the people is the voice of
God'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Authority therefore
belongs to those who exercise it for the benefit of the people, caring for the
people's needs, considering their views. Republicans see 'the people' as the
ultimate authority, but do<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>we have
the virtue required to have that authority? </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Those who seek power for
themselves are thereby unfitted for its exercise. Power is a contagious
'disease', waiting to infect whoever it is to whom 'the people' surrender their
power. There is much talk these days about people being empowered. More power
means more conflict. Democracy is about the reverse; reducing delegations of
power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus the answer lies
in reducing the powers of the powerful; commonly called devolution. Monarchists
say that the Governor General has no power, practically speaking, and that the
existing conventions deny power to the political executive, if only by reason
of the formalities of their observance. This is fragile. Any change at all may
bring down the whole house of cards! </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Like the elephant, 'which is so
slow', the people as a whole tend to find change a worry and would prefer to
put up with unsatisfactory politics rather than an unknown alternative - 'the
devil you don't know'. Distrust and fear play a big part in conservatism. But
what if the system we cling to is riddled with distrust and fear. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>To retain as much control as
possible over one's destiny is a natural urge. It appears strongly in the
movements for civil liberties. The problem is that in many ways we need the
benefits of common action, which requires compromise and even the surrender of
certain liberties for the greater good. Those benefits can become difficult to
see and appreciate if the basis of decision-making is clumsy and distorted in
giving opportunity for some to have a greater advantage than others. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>Serious change is needed, but can

confusion to create another. Some remarks by Sir William Deane (as Governor
General) stimulate thought about the future nature of the role of a president
under a republic. Some politicians have been upset that his remarks could be
influential in the republic debate. He has his defenders as well as his
critics, and he himself recognised early that to be other than a mere
figurehead (a role that has steadily metamorphosed with recent incumbents) a
fine line has to be drawn between highlighting problems of the disadvantaged,
and proposing or commenting on solutions. Empathy with the needy is a 'royal'
quality. Princess Diana had it. So had Sir William. That is the important
contribution for which a head-of-state will be revered. </span></p>

The following plan was put forward at the Constitutional Convention by The Hon.

appointed by a council of ex Governors-general etc., that would give minimal
change to the existing style of politics. This model received the second vote

three senior figures or Elders, with little else changed. The formal reference
made to the Queen in the current system could thus be replaced by reference to
the committee of Elders - a simple change. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span

 the High court become involved and prove to have the greater political power? What then of the
separation of powers? That has been seriously jeopardised already, with the

<br>
It has been suggested that, when occasion requires, all State Governors should
convene to privately 'invite' a respected citizen to accept appointment. It
could be provided further that conference with the State Governors would be
necessary before any reserve powers were exercised. Removal (under the special
circumstances of inability to perform the functions of the presidency, for any

merit, by the participation of the people in each state through their own

be objected that this proposal is still too far from a satisfactory involvement
of the people, but it appears to merit serious consideration. One significant
advantage, apart from its simplicity, would be the equality of influence it
would give for all states, in the ultimate appointment. Also the existing
constitutional arrangements with regard to Parliament might remain

to money than at earlier times when the parties were largely in the hands of
the grass roots. But party politics is, and always has been, a destructive
factor in their system. Our trend is the same, and more especially in future
with the recent law for tax deductibility of political donations! Incredible!

of such a definition of powers, a quiet aside from the Chair advised that it <b><i>is</i></b>

important of course, but not so critically. For example, Bill Hayden, former
left wing politician, reacted to the job of Governor General in much the same
way as more establishment figures have done. Obviously, the nature of the
office is a dominant factor<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and
with the president's powers properly defined, whoever is elected will act

presidential candidates could be promoted by both the 'right' and the 'left',
with the people's choice unpopular with the government. But a president with a
restricted role could not be a danger to government and making the election of
a powerless president a political issue would be pointless. The election of a
president really presents no big drama, or cause for alarm to our democratic
system; rather the reverse, provided only that the powers assigned to this

be one who would not be ambitious for the role. Doubtless Governors General
have never sought office; which has contributed to their strength. This
principle must be essential in moving to a republic. The public is quite
capable of nominating people of outstanding character and public spirit for the
office of president, the popular support being rapidly established in the
activity of all public forums, without (expensive) government intervention -
possible names being well profiled by the media. Thus the person chosen by the
people will be a person held in very high esteem, who has arisen in the public
mind by a process of natural selection, a process beyond the reach of political
influence. Any political attempt to influence the people with regard to such a

elect Democrats, Greens and Independents to the Senate in sufficient numbers

letter of dismissal should be tabled in parliament, and voted by secret ballot
of Members without debate. For such a matter to be argued over in parliament
seems to be the last thing that would be edifying; or in the public interest.
Immediate transmission of the letter should follow a requisite two-thirds
majority without delay. </span></p>

situation in the Senate since then. The public has taken advantage of
proportional representation in the Senate, with its small quotas of votes
required for each successful candidate and so, with the advent of Senate seats
won by Independents and minor parties, it is unlikely that there will ever be a
non-government majority in the Senate - the cause of the 1975 dust-up. Thus the
public seems to have resolved the 1975 problem. It is up to the people to
ensure that continues; to avoid dictatorial government. </span></p>

delete references to the Crown from the Federal Constitution obviously poses a
problem with regard to the states. Similar changes would be needed in each
