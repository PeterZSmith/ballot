<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>The High Court</strong></font></p>

<p>In the case of <i>Capital Television vs. The Commonwealth</i>
the High Court has given its reasons for rejecting the
Government's ban on political advertising during an election
period. The Court found that the text of the Constitution implies
that a freedom of communication is essential to the conduct of
representative government, which is specifically provided for in
the Constitution. Freedom of speech, dissemination of
information, discourse and political discussion, were all seen to
be implied by the Constitution as part of the process enabling
voters to make informed judgements on the choices before them in
an election. The Court, by majority decision, ruled that there
was no compelling justification for parliamentary interference
with political advertisements during the period leading up to an
election. </p>

<p>The opinions of the Court, which were critical to the
decision, appear to centre on subjective assessments of whether
the effect of political advertising in the run-up to an election
is harmful or otherwise, rather than questions of law. Mr.
Justice Brennan clearly thought that TV advertising did not
promote intelligent political discussion or assessment of
political choices. In his view it would appear that such
advertising had the major purpose of persuading voters by more
subtle methods; appealing to the emotional rather than the
rational side of voters' nature. </p>

<p>Accusations of scare tactics would tend to verify his opinion.
TV advertisements in the October '92 Victorian election may have
been more objective than some, but the Independents were
certainly not amused by the Liberal 'smear' that a vote for an
Independent was a vote for Labor. </p>

<p>Mr. Justice Dawson spelt out an important and far-reaching
distinction in his dissenting judgement (<i>The Age</i> 1/10/92):
'In this country the guarantee of fundamental freedoms does not
lie in any constitutional mandate but in the capacity of a
democratic society to preserve its own shared values.' But shared
values have become less than clear, and the undemocratic nature
of our parliamentary system hinders the ability of society to
protect its fundamental freedoms. </p>

<p><b>The 'Problem' of the 'Executive' </b></p>

<p>The judges have shown concern over the problem which has been
central to the thesis of this book - the problem of the dominance
of Parliament (and of course the people) by the 'executive' (the
Cabinet formed from the majority party), especially where the
government can control the Upper House - a situation bordering on
dictatorship, even if temporary.</p>

<p>We have already discussed at some length the reasons why the
party system has undermined and destroyed the ability of
parliaments to rule with accountability in the democratic manner
envisaged in the forming of the Federal Constitution in the 1890s
- without parties occupying the dominant role that they rapidly
acquired after Federation. </p>

<p>Concern with these matters came to light in a speech by Mr.
Justice Toohey at a conference in Darwin on constitutional
change. Referring to the traditional role of parliament as the
defender of the people's liberties, he said: '... parliaments are
increasingly seen to be the <i>de facto </i>agents or
facilitators of executive power, rather than bulwarks against
it.' </p>

<p><b>A New Role for the High Court? </b></p>

<p>Mr. Justice Toohey indicated a possibility of the courts
taking up a new role in protecting the fundamental liberties of
the people based on the common law. In the absence of a formal
bill of rights he felt that the courts may find it necessary over
time to construct an 'implied Bill of Rights', by interpretation
of the actual text of the Constitution in the light of 'natural
law'. </p>

<p>The Chief Justice's view in this matter was quoted by Margo
Kingston <font size="1"><sup>21</sup></font> in an article
entitled, 'Just Who is Judging Victoria'. Mr. Justice Mason, she
said '...only gradually and reluctantly came to accept the idea
of a wider involvement over a long period, as it seemed to him
quite foreign to our democratic heritage of parliamentary
safeguards'. </p>

<p>Decisions of the Court and the flurry of consequential public
comment show a depth of concern with regard to the idea of a
wider role for the courts. The judges seem to have been quite
surprised at the public reaction. </p>

<p>Mr. Justice Toohey went on to suggest that in the absence of a
constitutional bill of rights, a Court &quot;... as a guardian of
a written constitution ... might feel a responsibility to apply
principles of 'natural law' ... to protect core
liberal-democratic values&quot;. The Court would thus be
departing from a traditional position of confining itself to a
strict interpretation of the law; (a process, however, that
aggravated many in the Barwick Court's interpretation of law in
tax avoidance cases). </p>

<p>The Court now appears to be looking at the <i>possible</i>
intentions of the people when they passed the Constitution in the
1890s. </p>

<p>Mr. Justice Toohey gave the opinion that: &quot; It might be
contended that the courts should ... conclude that where the
people of Australia, in adopting a constitution, conferred power
to legislate upon a Commonwealth Parliament, it is to be presumed
they did not intend that those grants of power extend to invasion
of fundamental common law liberties. </p>

<p>He noted that the judiciary is the 'weakest' of the three arms
of government; that &quot;judicial review can never amount to
government&quot;, but it could: &quot; ... frustrate ... the will
... of a current majority of members of a legislature, which does
not necessarily coincide with the will of the majority of its
citizens.&quot; </p>

<p>The court has shown that it <em>can </em>set limits to the
legislative power of the executive. Mr. Justice Toohey reminds us
that this capacity is restricted to the situation where laws are
imprecise and conflict with 'natural law', but that parliament by
<em>precise</em> legal construction has a final say, just as the
people can overturn a decision of the courts by referendum.
However precise legal construction to have that 'final say' would
require legal genius of, perhaps, a clairvoyant order, to render
legislation High Court proof. The Barwick decisions caused a vast
increase in the size and complexity of tax legislation; and we
still have tax avoidance. Only retrospective legislation could
have halted that avalanche.</p>

<p>Mr. Justice Toohey argues that since it is open to the people
to amend the Constitution by referendum (if instructed to!) the
Court should be seen as democratic and not 'anti-majoritarian' in
its interpretation of the Constitution. Rather he feels the Court
&quot;should be seen as representing the people, in giving
protection to individual rights in advance of ratification by
referendum&quot;. (There is, of course, no opening at present for
the public to require a referendum to be held on any matter.)
Worries about an executive president pale into insignificance by
comparison. </p>

<p>The suggestion that a court might be more able than parliament
to represent the views of the community, and that it might come
to exercise a right to do so, created something of a furore. The
Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, objected strongly, despite
the efforts of the Attorney-General, Mr. Duffy, to quieten the
matter and remove the whole discussion from the public domain.
Senator Shacht was another to be 'up in arms' with the suggested
diminishment of the role of parliament. In calling such a trend
undemocratic he is in company with Aristotle. Democracy means
government in the hands of 'the many' rather than 'the few'. </p>

<p>The Law Institute of Victoria has called for a legislative
bill of rights to ease the burden of the High Court, a change
which would eventually be embodied in the Constitution by
referendum. But Canada, in separating from the United Kingdom,
followed the American example of a bill of rights, and is finding
a resultant politicisation of the judiciary. Is this really the
way we want to go? </p>

<p>Any change in the rights and powers under the Constitution
should certainly be submitted to the people by way of referendum
not by legal decision. Mark Snedden, senior law lecturer, Monash
University, made this point quite forcibly <font size="1"><sup>22</sup></font>
. He questions the right of judges, who are not elected and for
whom there is no review, to 'veto the will of the majority
expressed through Parliament', an elected body. </p>

<p>Others too are objecting to a widened role for the High Court,
taking issue with the notion that judges, whose appointment comes
under extremely little public notice or examination, let alone
control, should be able to overrule the laws made by an elected
body in a democracy. Once again democracy (and therefore freedom)
is enhanced by reducing powers, wherever they have become
excessive, not in increasing sectional power. </p>

<p>Attention has been drawn to the American manner of appointment
of their Supreme Court judges and the practice of conducting a
wide-ranging public enquiry into the suitability of the proposed
appointee; a process made necessary by the greater powers vesting
in their Supreme Court. While this has its validity, it simply
results in legitimising an enhanced role for the Courts. The more
powerful is each source of power, the more serious are the
conflicts. </p>

<p>The growing necessity felt by the High Court to act on behalf
of the 'fundamental freedoms', is perhaps understandable when the
corrupted nature of the operation of our parliaments is
considered. This is where the problem lies; where the failure of
democracy is to be found. Compared with the public imvolvement of
the previous century Australian democracy is in a state of decay.
</p>

<p><b>A Failing System</b> </p>

<p>In her article summarising the various backgrounds and
approaches of the present High Court Justices , Margo Kingston<font
size="1"><sup> 15</sup></font> records the view expressed by
Justices Mason and Brennan that parliaments are tending to avoid
the hardest political decisions in the hope that the courts may
resolve the issues and save <i>them</i> political 'flack'! </p>

<p>As to the question of the adoption of a Bill of Rights by
constitutional amendment, it would appear that party governments,
through the past failures of referenda, have lost the desire and
the necessary will to put such questions to the people. This
points again to the unsatisfactory weakness (and possibly also
the impurity of motive) of party governments when seeking to
implement the changes they deem necessary . They are simply not
trusted. </p>

<p><b>Other 'Freedoms'?</b> </p>

<p>The question of whose freedoms might be guaranteed by some
fresh implications to be found in the Constitution could be a
worry. As mentioned earlier, one fellow's freedom can be a threat
to another's. Public discussion subsequent to Mr. Justice
Toohey's speech in Darwin has raised a range of other matters
which some have thought might come up for review as a result of
the new trend apparent in the thinking of the Court. The Court's
decision has been greeted with some enthusiasm by the media which
probably sees some possibility of relief from defamation
litigation. Up front also is the tobacco industry, which scents
hope for elimination of the bans on advertisement of their
products, although some comfort may be taken by the report,
quoted by Margo Kingston, of a 'friend of some judges': &quot;...
if people think they'll overturn the ban on cigarette
advertising, they're dead wrong.&quot;. </p>

<p><b>Cynicism</b> </p>

<p>It has been said that the adverse effect of the Court's
overrulling the political advertising ban, in raising the level
of community cynicism, could be as bad or worse than the effect
of the protection given to tax avoiders some time ago. The
depressing effect of cynicism diminishes the morale and well
being of the whole people. Fine principles must carry through to
benefit all equally. Our parliaments must be able to provide ways
for fast-tracking solutions to the problems of <i>anyone </i>suffering
injustice. There is much to be done by way of reform to redeem
our political situation from its present malaise. Real freedom
requires real democracy. </p>

<p>In the end it must be the people's judgement which determines
the issues. No matter how responsible any Court or Executive may
be, the power to make decisions is no more than a trust from the
people. Nothing is, nor can be, final in politics. That is why
political decisions must be decided politically. It is clearly
desirable that the separation of powers should not work in an
antagonistic way, but that each function should be free to pursue
its recognised historical function. The decision in the Capital
Television case, the speech in Darwin by Mr. Justice Toohey and
the subsequent airing of views by politicians and others against
an expanded role for the High Court are quite significant
political developments. They each point to where our major
problem lies - the hijack of our parliaments by the party system.
</p>

<p><b>The High Court and the Common Law</b> </p>

<p>The responsibility, newly perceived by the High Court, to
invoke principles of the Common Law in its 'creative'
interpretation of the Constitution, will, quite clearly, not be
abandoned at the wish of politicians. This is not to say that the
High Court is necessarily 'right' in its (majority) judgements.
What is 'right' must reflect considered public opinion in a
democracy, including public opinion changing and maturing in its
viewpoint. But one High Court Justice has suggested that, if the
Court has the 'wave-length' of the public, its decisions might be
regarded as more democratic than those of Parliament.) </p>

<p>The concern of parliamentarians is understandable. The first
'blow' is often decisive. It becomes difficult for Parliament to
undo a Court decision which has already granted 'rights'. New law
has always been the responsibility of parliament and this
invasion of their domain is a rank departure from the Westminster
principle of the separation of powers; between the three arms of
government - Legislature, Executive and the Court. However the
separation of powers between legislatures and executives
collapsed long ago, because of party discipline and executive
cornering of excessive power. Executives have become, in these
critical times, combative, dilatory and rough instruments of
democratic justice. So, in a sense, Parliament has 'asked for
it'. It has lost the initiative. </p>

<p>The wheels of our 'democratic' process are creaking. It does
not encourage and facilitate an intelligent, objective
involvement by the public. An example of better involvement is
the Swiss practice of the popular initiative. This process tends
to urge the people to more constructive thinking - which is badly
needed, since the national task of decision-making is becoming
more complex rather than less, as the future rushes upon us. </p>

<p>If politicians are reluctant to allow the public more
involvement in the decisions which affect us all, then perhaps
the running battle with the High Court will continue. An English
Judge of some renown, Lord Denning by name, was written up in a
Herald editorial some years ago under the title of 'More Lordly
Thinking'. This judge, it appeared, often upset lawyers by
applying the law with discretion based on reason and justice,
rather than a blind following of intricate legal reasoning and
inappropriate precedent.</p>

<p>Peter Ellingsen <font size="1"><sup>23</sup></font>, likens
his old newspaper colleague, Murray Smith, to 'former US Supreme
Court chief justice, Earl Warren, who was known to whisper to
advocates, &quot;Yes, yes, I know the legal arguments. But is it
fair?&quot; '</p>

<p>What a delight! And what an example to explode the humbug of
the politically (or legally) correct! </p><P>
