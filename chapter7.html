<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-AU
style='color:windowtext'>The secret ballot, employed IN our parliaments, will
lead to an advance to a real democracy with genuine local representation and true
parliamentary government, breaking down the gross violation of representative
democracy by the party system. It is the lack of this most important element of
democratic procedure that has caused the climate for the slide of democracy
into the ugliness of party politics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='color:windowtext'>The proposed system will be very simple and
reliable, presenting little technical difficulty. It will count the votes
rapidly - in a fraction of a second when called upon - and so will be able to
be used liberally at the beginning, during and at the conclusion of debate,
whenever desired. Thus speakers will be able to request a vote on their input
and have an instant, clear affirmation or otherwise of their position. The
system will display the 'Ayes' and 'Noes' for all to see - on TV as well,
classic public viewing, to see the immediate endorsement of sensible views and
discomfiture of foolish ones. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='color:windowtext'>The system, being secret, will not be able
to keep any record of Members' individual votes cast. The Member's performance
will then be the critical factor for constituents concerned with the results in
parliament and the accountability of their Member. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='color:windowtext'>It is quite clear also that, the votes
being secret, influence on any Member to conform will not be feasible. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>On the other hand, there will be an open
opportunity for all members to freely and strongly canvass deeply held
convictions of any kind, doctrinaire or otherwise. The difference will be that the
parliament will be able to rule on each Member&#8217;s contribution without any undue
delay. This will generate a purposeful dynamic to each debate, with quick progress
to the best decisions. The sittings of parliament will often be riveting, with the
public becoming much more interested in the more frequent parliamentary

the loss of control of 'their' Members. Those vanished funds may well be spent
independently by various interests in informing the public of their specific
concerns. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span

one of respected leadership, but without any special powers by virtue of
office. It will be a rank well deserved - a position of honour. The person so

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='color:windowtext'>The election of all Cabinet Ministers,
committees, and other appointments will be by ballot, and each person so
appointed, will be responsible to Parliament alone. The Cabinet will thus be a
body of administrators acting on behalf of parliament, under its authority.
They will contribute to policy, but not have control over it. Their
responsibility will be to administer the decisions of parliament, being also
free to exercise effective leadership on any issue from the floor of the House.
Clearly, the position of a Minister will be entirely different to that which
now applies. An initial shakeout will occur, the best people being quickly
elected to the various offices, regardless of previous affiliations.
Thenceforth the fall of a government will be a logical impossibility, the
parliament itself being the government.  <p>

 Any Member could be elected a Minister.
Each will then hold office at the pleasure of the Parliament - still being
judged by Members to be the most suitable person to administer the particular
area of responsibility. As an able leader and administrator of a department,
tenure of office will be much more secure - not being subject to the present
unsettling requirements of party strategy and the uncertainties of party
election success. At present, changes in the Ministry may be made from
party-image considerations; and some changes may be avoided for similar
reasons. And of course the loss of an election always means the clean sweep of
all offices at present.  <p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='color:windowtext'>With secret ballots in parliament,
replacement of individual Ministers will never be made capriciously. The
present party-based motivation for attacking a Minister will vanish and any
move seeking the removal of an officer for unworthy or capricious reasons will
be quickly dismissed; such <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>being likely to rebound on the person
responsible. Censure motions, which may occur from time to time, will concern
the activities of a Minister only, never threatening to the &#8216;government', as at
present. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='color:windowtext'>The election to an office by parliament
itself will confer freedom of action on Ministers and other officers, within
the powers delegated in each case, but circumscribed by the active supervision
of Parliament - there will no longer be automatic and pointless party-based
opposition. While there will be active opposition to unpalatable proposals
before the House, a permanent 'Opposition', as such, will no longer exist.
Accountability of Ministers and others directly to parliament will also be in
marked contrast to the present situation, where accountability is to the
relevant party hierarchy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='color:windowtext'>With parliament balloting all decisions,
and in full control, it may be that Ministers could occasionally even be
appointed from outside the Parliament - i.e. acknowledged experts in particular
fields - with complete responsibility always to Parliament. Unlike the American
system, in which the President makes such executive appointments, this could
not lead to 'political' appointments, because of the new power of parliament to
rule. A trend creeping <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>- jobs for
friends etc. will be cut off. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='color:windowtext'>More talent is likely to become available
from Member ranks. It is not hard to imagine the new system drawing the
interest of significant candidates who at present would not even think of being
involved in the nonsense of party politics. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

parliaments will outdo Westminster democracy, governing with an authority which
will mute the cry for 'rights', because, while majority views will rule,
minority concerns will receive due consideration. The ethics of parliament will
be established and the people will respond to the new, fair system.
International interest will follow and the 'Australian Ballot' of the 19th
century will be followed by the 'Australian Democracy&#8217; of the 22nd, inspiring
emulation. Ambitious? Not a bit of it. We can do it! We should do it. We owe it
to the world as the world leader in democratic practice that we are. We have
international standing in many things. Let us advance to world acclaim in this
most important area as well. The state of politics in many countries cries out

enable all Members to have a fully valid and equal opportunity to exercise
their talents within the parliamentary process. It should be borne in mind that
the opportunity for each Member to affect the decisions of parliament, directly
through debate in the parliament will be something quite new. It will be a
complete <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>change from the present
tirades in parliament, which, apart from being totally inappropriate, are
totally ineffective to change one Member's vote, because of the tight party

lang=EN-AU style='color:windowtext'>The leading of policies will be open to all
Members of Parliament, with Ministers also presenting policies emanating from
the bureaucracy. Party 'platforms' will be a thing of the past. Formulation of
public policy will take place in a rapidly forming non-partisan political
climate. Politics will be all about 'issues', with a strongly growing
confidence that nothing good for the country is impossible. Policy suggestions will
be able to come from any source, channelling through any Member, and receive
consideration by Parliament according to merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-AU style='color:windowtext'><span style="mso-spacerun:

policies and discourage others from making progress. One commentator has
described the proposed system as a &#8216;filter&#8217; - with good policies passing
through relatively rapidly, but bad policies having no chance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='color:windowtext'>A much closer cooperation will arise
between constituents and Members in the sifting and development of community
views on various issues, according to their importance in the local and
national scene. Members will conduct regular public meetings, with initiatives
coming from individuals, and from interest groups. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Initiatives will
also issue through Ministers from the bureaucracy, from the media, and from
constituents through their Members. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>No proposal will create fear, so innovative ideas won't be
unpopular, although infeasible ideas will quickly fade away. Parliament alone
will have the power to decide issues; by ballot of the Members. With many more
in the community able to be involved in face-to-face, open discussion of
issues, it will become possible for the harder issues to be efficiently
tackled. The ideal of community participation includes communication both
horizontal (among constituents) and vertical, between the constituents and
their Member. At times Representatives will need to promote the wider interests
of the nation amongst the people. Similarly the people will be arguing with their
Representatives for the community's concerns and needs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU style='color:windowtext'>Policy development will be unified from the
grass roots up by the new process rather than parties and groups developing
conflicting policies <i>in isolation</i> with an eye always to attracting power.
Many policy matters can then be thoroughly researched, differences fully
discussed, and consensus reached in the community, saving much time in Parliament.
This should do away with the present practice of government 'kite-flying', and
the bold announcement of government initiatives, from which retreat has often
to be made - clumsy government. Cross-examination of proposals will occur to a
great extent in the regular public meetings, knowledgeable people in the
appropriate field being much in evidence. But if 'experts' try to 'pull the
wool over the eyes' of the people they will receive 'short shrift' indeed.
Various points of view will receive appropriate hearing, but undue favour to
any particular point of view, will be precluded by the open debate in the
community and in parliament, and the parliamentary secret ballot. There will be
one very significant missing factor - the clout and priority that at present
attaches to certain privileged people, their groups, and their interests. <o:p></o:p></span>
<p>

 The present torrent of complex, and often
ineffectual, legislation, is likely to dwindle considerably. With the time, previously
wasted in party defence and attack, becoming available, past legislation can
then be reviewed.

democratic basis on each matter before it, its prestige as a governing body

achieve new levels of effectiveness and respect. With the system of
representation by Members freed <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>by the secret ballot, changes in public
opinion will be quickly and accurately manifested in the debate and voting in
parliament. Thus, instead of the present waste of time in debates distracted by
party feuding, decisions by Members to support or oppose specific bills will be
guided by their own considered opinions in the light of the debate in the
House, putting an end to the predetermined outcomes and rubber-stamping of
party decisions by subdued parliaments. The open debating in parliament will
contrast markedly with the secret debates in party rooms, in which decisions,
to be inflicted on parliament and people, are presently made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-AU style='color:windowtext'><span style="mso-spacerun:

preliminary and progressive parliamentary voting, but the simple electronic
system will enable very quick 'straw' votes throughout the course of a debate,
enabling sound decisions to mature rapidly with Members changing decisions during
the course of the debate from time to time, as appropriate. There will be a new
flexibility and power in Parliament with voting becoming crucial to all
decisions. Where an acceptable majority occurs at the commencement of (or early
in) debate Parliament will be able to move on without further delay. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>For a Member to vote in a manner contrary to the Member&#8217;s public stance
on an issue would be quite ridiculous, in the context of the Members' newfound
opportunity to sway the votes of other Members by capable debate. In addition
the deceptive ploy would almost certainly be detected with disastrous personal
results for the Member. Personality attacks will be useless for winning votes
on the issue before the House, and will be assiduously avoided by Members, as
destructive to both their causes and careers. Point scoring and grandstanding,
will score no points at all, neither in the House nor with the public, being
entirely counterproductive in the new political climate. <span

'swinging voters' are more numerous. The present rate of discard of Members, in
many cases a real loss to the community, is a matter of concern. In addition,
under the present unstable system the frequency of short tenures has made it
necessary for MPs to have rights to substantial pensions, after terms of
service that are brief compared with other occupations. The reason has been
given (whether true or not) that candidates have sacrificed other careers for
an uncertain stint in parliament. Such compensatory provision will hardly be
necessary with the re-election of Members depending purely on their own efforts.

local meetings, the quality of those involved, Members and potential rivals,
will be visible on a continuous basis. It follows that the candidates for the

persuasion will be relied on regarding measures not, at first, well appreciated

greater community understanding, and respect for the political process, harmony

Stability of government and community life will be considerably enhanced.
Business will barely hesitate in its stride with a looming election. Compare

give the people democratic leadership, avoiding the problem and concentrating
on the conflict.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With real
political reform the media will become more important. Attention will centre on
the process of policy development, the trend of parliamentary debate, the
acceptability of balloted decisions, estimates of public and minority reaction.
</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>The
debate will become public, and media and people will quickly pounce upon any
hint of a hidden agenda, dictating the content or style of any Member&#8217;s
debating. Political journalists and commentators will be particularly involved
in analyses of matters on the agenda, before the debate in parliament. These
analyses will be of prime public interest and will be followed through until
the outcome of the parliamentary ballot. There will be real opportunity for
significant input from the people, who will quickly sense the new ability to
affect the process leading to the ultimate decision by the ballot in
parliament. Many<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>with a

assiduously, and any aberrant arguing or behaviour will incur prompt and
voluminous criticism from all sides. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>People
will be much better informed with regard to both the issues and the performance
and quality of Members and other candidates at election times. In addition to
the parliamentary broadcasts, and local meetings, various current-affairs
programmes on television will be important in focusing attention on the issues
on the agenda. The print media's in-depth analysis of the issues will fill an
even more effectual role, adding considerably to the active discussion of
issues in public meetings. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>Any
attempt at manipulation of public opinion will become rapidly obvious. One
aspect, which will come to the fore, is the question of media ownership. Media

government. Fixed terms could be a distinct possibility.<span

</span>Secret Ballots in Parliament will provide both the opportunity and the
essential safeguards for such an upgrade and diversification of the vital
function of leadership in our community. With this reform, each Member will
have a much more vital and effective role to play in the House, being

need to urgently cultivate their constituents' goodwill; and the missing link
in the chain of participation, responsibility, and representation, will be
complete. </p>

these meetings lively discussion and consultation will take place, giving both
constituents and Members intimate knowledge of the views held by each, and the
importance and priority to be attached to the various local and national
matters and policies arising. In this climate, life will become very torrid for
any Member who fails to obtain the acceptance and confidence of the
constituents. These local meetings and the reporting of the local press will be
significant factors in reaching and informing the electorate. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>These
meetings will provide a new opportunity for significant involvement for many
who at present have none. Think of an elderly person who has never been
involved in anything political but, being concerned about a public matter, goes
to a meeting convened by the local Member, makes a succinct suggestion to the
meeting, and then goes home. Such a person will be able to rest, content in the
knowledge that the worthwhile thought has been noted, and will be acted upon,
with no less certainty because that person has no particular status, nor
personally pursues the matter further. In a secret ballot system it is likely
that the concern and its expression will be sufficient to set any necessary
action in motion, with other people prodding, should the Member not be disposed
to act. That will be real democracy. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>Is
that too much to expect? There is really nothing to prevent this kind of
outcome. It merely needs the openness of the public to see the need for this
important reform and the will to follow it up. For many members of the public,
necessary response need not be considerable<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>The
advent of realistic public meetings convened by Members, newly and acutely

candidates<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>who could be seen
well in advance of an election.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their presence will be a considerable challenge to the Member for quality
representation. The ongoing retention of a seat will thus depend on the Member
being seen by the constituents as doing everything possible, including forceful
debate and advocacy in parliament, for furthering the proper interests of the
electorate. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>Parochial
interests and concerns will sometimes have to be surrendered to the public
interest - the well-being of the country as a whole - which, in the long run,
is likely to be enlightened self-interest. So the Member may sometimes have to
argue with the electorate; to secure a less parochial viewpoint. The new powers
and opportunities will enable worthwhile Members to be <i>statesmen</i>; and
they will accordingly receive a new respect if they can qualify.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>The
decisions of parliament will no longer be stereotyped according to the
rigidities of a party platform, or changes in a ruling party's policy. Nor will
the electorate any longer be certain of the Member's vote on each issue. The
new situation will attract the close attention of concerned people to the debate
and resulting decisions in parliament; especially to the Member's performance
in the House in pursuit of the electorate's point of view. Imagine the dynamics
of the situation: the housewife at her ironing, the farmer on his tractor, or
the brick-layer laying bricks, all following the broadcast of the Member's
debating in Parliament on a worrying issue. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>In
effect, each Member, with a new power to change the 'mind' of parliament, will
become acutely accountable for what the parliament does, or fails to do. The
local Member's views and aims will be known on a personal basis by a much
larger number of constituents than heretofore, ushering in a new era of
enhanced representation. Numbers in local meetings will become substantial when
things are not going well for the electorate, and there will be the constant
demand by the people for real representation. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>The
key issue will be the electorate's opinion of the Member's performance, in
parliament, in regular public meetings, and in personal relationship with
constituents. A happy result in parliament on a specific issue will reflect
credit on the sitting Member, while an unsatisfactory action of Parliament will
see the &#8216;bees&#8217; swarming! </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It is suggested that, rather than
providing for a vote for a Member to abstain, where a matter is of the
significance to warrant debate each MP has a responsibility to respond on
behalf of the electorate. It is quite true that matters vary considerably in
complexity and it is clear that the understanding and expertise of some exceeds
that of others. However in matters political, everyone has to make judgments
based on their own understanding, but when that is limited we assess the
integrity and clarity of understanding of those who lead in debate. We thus
reach a conclusion and make a decision to the best of our ability on all those
facts before us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An MP is no
different. Decisions have to be made on available facts and to have no opinion
at all about a matter under debate would be a shirking of responsibility. It is
therefore concluded that there should be no departure from the existing
practice of requiring MPs to choose YES or NO in every vote. </p>

text-indent:.2in'><strong>Interest Groups will remain?</strong></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>People
&#8216;like to form groups, debate within those groups and arrive at joint views'.
Just so. This was already recognised earlier. The ballot proposal has no
jurisdiction at all over private activity. However it is predicted that this
radical change will result in a new phenomenon - the rise of the common forum -
the local meetings conducted by MPs in response to the community's demand for
effective consultation and input. Such meetings will form the backbone of a
system of MP accountability, which does not currently exist. The past habit of
local parties and groups meeting to discuss and debate in isolation will be
less profitable and will yield in importance to the new common forum. </p>

<p align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;
text-indent:.2in'><strong>Ballot everything?</strong></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>Should
the House ballot every question? Reference was made to the original Greek
practice in which the public debated only controversial questions. The point is
valid. The issue then is really what should be debated in the House and what
not. A system of public tabling of all matters not included in the agenda for
debate in the House should enable protest to be made where necessary. This will
ensure that any matter can be added to the agenda if justified by public
concern. On the other hand, should a demand for debate be vexatious, the matter
could be simply disposed of in seconds by electronic secret vote when the House
is sitting. </p>

<p align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;
text-indent:.2in'><strong>Instability?</strong></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>A
serious reservation is that the notion of a House of Independent MPs would lead
to instability. This was the case before the formation of the major parties and
the reason they came into being. There was nothing to stop different opinions
being fiercely maintained and, by wheeling and dealing, sufficient numbers
obtained to gain success on a pet issue. That would certainly happen again <i>without
the ballot in parliament</i>. But with the ballot, every view that cannot
acquire the necessary majority of secretly voting Members will fail. Wheeling
and dealing will become virtually impossible, and in any case, will be
unacceptable in the new environment. Any remaining wheelers and dealers&#8217; will
be hissed, and ostracized in the corridors of Parliament. The ballot will be a
stern disciplinarian, with its plain message: win the majority over by
persuasive argument; or fail. Parties may persist for a time but the ballot
will diminish their utility progressively in the new surge toward the
blossoming power of a non-partisan parliament. The secret ballot will force
Parliament toward cohesive decision on each issue. As the arguments are put,
and the progressive votes instantaneously taken, the view of the House will
consolidate around the best answers, through the active participation of the
Members, not necessarily all debating, but all voting. Clearly there are only
two options, the bringing in or the throwing out of any motion. It may happen
that the debate does not resolve the issue at first - no clear majority. The
matter will then be deferred for research. It may be that the developing
familiarity with the process could introduce a custom of requiring a more
significant majority for some issues of greater moment than others e.g.
war!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Parliament will be able to
freely decide such matters in the new non-partisan environment. A motion to
defer could then override a narrow majority in cases where a substantial
majority would be preferable.</p>

text-indent:.2in'><strong>How can politicians be trusted?</strong></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>With
every politician becoming uniquely accountable to the electorate, they will no
longer be &#8216;politicians&#8217; but Representatives. Accountability therefore will
revolve around the diligent follow up work of the people in the electorate. This
will not require the involvement of everyone, just the concerned; a body of
constituents varying considerably from time to time, depending on the issues
arising. The local meetings will balloon where there is dissatisfaction or
serious concerns. The local media will be a very significant help to the public
by keeping all informed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

text-indent:.2in'><b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Corruption?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Any<i> </i>thinking person knows that
corruption is already rife under the anti-democratic party system. Party
loyalty is obligatory for politicians by virtue of the privilege of
endorsement. They are compelled to put the party first, ahead of the wishes of
the electorate. Just who does the Representative represent? Members aspiring to
Cabinet rank, to what, and to whom, are their efforts and energies directed?
The party! Is that not bribery?</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></i><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>We have also seen investigations launched over cases of
alleged bribery and corruption in four States, so what protection is the party
system against such things? None at all, in fact the party system is a prime
cause.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious that our
political/legal system has no significant ability to prevent corruption. And
there is a real worry over the way leaders of investigations into corruption
and other matters of public concern have been hounded and vilified. One wonders
sometimes just what priority justice has under the law. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>The
power of party Ministers to make decisions conceding benefits to selected
groups helps the party image and election chances. It is well known that the
party in power has the advantage at an election through its access to knowledge
and facilities This is the direct result of elevating particular politicians to
positions of power without reference to parliament or people.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The powers and privileges arranged by the
party system are a corrupting influence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We should not forget that the problem of the failure of accountability
of government is not because of the public not knowing, but that, even though
knowing, ordinary people are unable to do anything at all about it. Hence
cynicism prevails. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>The
Australian attitude is quite ambivalent. On the one hand there is the desire
for strong leaders. On the other hand is the desire to cut down the 'tall
poppies'. Perhaps it is an intellectual laziness on our part which wants to
shed the responsibilities of self-government, shunting them onto 'good'
leaders; then taking up a position of anger, and self-righteous disgust, when
they turn out to be no better than we are, and not equal to the responsibility.
It is the system under which they labour which ruins the representative
capacity of 'good' people. </p>

<p align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;
text-indent:.2in'><b>Secret Bribery of Members?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>As
to the ability of Parliament to deal with any danger of bribery, we might
compare the likelihood of such actions passing undetected, following a change
to the secret ballot in our parliaments. In Tasmania a Member was approached
with a view to bribery. The person making the approach made a bad mistake, as
the Member promptly reported the matter. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>Under
the party system, it may only require an approach to one person to make a very
great change in the political situation, when a party government may stand or
fall on the acquisition or loss of one supporting Member. This was the case in
Tasmania. But under a secret ballot system, no one will be able to predict the
outcome of any particular ballot. How then will some misguided person know how
to carry out a plan of bribery? It is certain that nothing could be achieved
except by corrupting a <b><i>number</i></b> of Members; and that on a single
issue, not the formation of a government with power to decide all the issues!
It is obvious that the escalating risk of discovery, for little and uncertain
gain would be horrendous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In any
case with the secrecy of the ballot it would be useless to depend on any Member
to vote as required by a bribe anyway. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>Someone
has suggested that promises of secret reward could be made depending on the
result of the ballot on a specific issue. But how many would have to change
their votes to succeed? How many secret votes could be relied on to carry out
the criminal conspiracy? There is also the microscope of attention by media and
public, which will fasten on to the parliamentary process, as a result of the
secrecy of the ballot process. There will be an acute sensitivity to any
'scent' of undue influence affecting decisions and public ire will be easily
aroused in place of the current helpless apathy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So attempting to carry out the illegal plan
would have no certainty apart from failure and prosecution! It is ridiculous to
suppose that the introduction of the secret ballot will increase the incidence
of corruption. It obviously won't - it will eradicate it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such problems will be very largely, or
altogether, eliminated, as significant open debate and public scrutiny revive
in the community and Members are freed from party politics and its corrupting
responsibilities.</p>

text-indent:.2in'><b>Britain, in Wartime.</b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>The
question has been asked, 'How did the British all-party government operate
during the second world war'? Does this throw light on the manner in which a
secret ballot parliament would work?</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>Winston
Churchill, maverick politician, was not a rebel against the Westminster
system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He tolerated the
restrictions of the system until, months after commencement of the war, the
King asked him to form a new government. He did and his 'Grand Coalition'
exemplifies the tenor of a Cabinet elected by secret ballot - the best person
for each job. He was no dictator but the war demanded strong government. It was
no doubt the seriousness of the crisis and the stature of the man that enabled
the Commons to work as one, and with the support of the country, to do the
necessary miracles they did. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>It
seems reasonable to suppose that had government decisions been put to a ballot
of the Commons the answer would have been the same. Which seems to indicate
that pressure of circumstance can 'concentrate the mind wonderfully' so that
reaching the right answer may be slow in peace, but cannot in war. But there is
no doubt that the discipline of the ballot will give the right answers by
genuine majority decision of conscience votes of Members; and with a minimum of
waste of time. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'>It
would not have been necessary for Chamberlain to be deposed for the required
action to be undertaken, as the parliament would have been making the
decisions, sidestepping the inertia of party government. Churchill's drive for
war preparation could well have been agreed to by the Commons <i>at a much
earlier date</i>, the Prime Minister not having the final say as to what could
or could not be done. A resounding confidence in the Commons would have
resulted, with Churchill a key figure but not requiring Cabinet office to
achieve necessary action. This points up the leadership flexibility, and
parliamentary strength that will follow introduction of the secret ballot in
Parliament as well as for elections.</p>
