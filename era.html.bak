<blockquote>
 These  ardent souls were longing for a light  that  never  was, on sea or
land, for an ideal happiness which was  to be obtained  through  constitutional 
 reforms,  though  unobtainable unless man should be of a sudden  renovated, his
 animal  nature  transformed, his  weakness  and  his passions, his meanness and
his follies, all deleted from his  character.  They found no Utopia, such as 
they  had  dreamed  of,  but they saw in a few short  years  a  very great
movement in the direction of their fervent hopes.p.357.  
<br /><br />  ...in  regard to other matters of popular  clamour,  all  were won before
a very few years had passed away. Manhood  suffrage, <b>the Ballot</b>, abolition of
property qualification     for  Members  of Parliament, the   <b>equality  of 
electoral  districts</b></a>, <b> short</b> Parliaments, the eight hours system  of labour, 
and other ideals of the Chartist Party at  home,     had been secured.p.358.   </blockquote>
  
 
         
  At  a  meeting  at Bakery Hill, Ballarat, at  which  some  ten  thousand 
men  were said to have been present,  resolutions  were  carried  'that it was
the inalienable right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is
called upon to obey.' p.364.         
<br /><br /> At the next meeting the flag now known as the Eureka flag  was  hoisted. It
was evident that '...the want of all political rights  and recognised status was
naturally felt as a grievance by a body of men who were unusually intelligent
and active.'        
<br /><br /> At  the trial of the men captured at Eureka 'not guilty'  verdicts  were 
given by juries backed by a sympathetic  public.  It  should  be realised that
the bulk of the public had no vote;  the  population had doubled within the last
ten years and few had  the  necessary land qualification to enable them to vote. 
 
<br /><br /> In the midst of the political activity which occurred in  this  period: 
       
<blockquote> ...there  was one concession earnestly longed  for...the    
system of <i><b>voting  at elections by secret ballot</b></i>. All  democratic  ideals
included this provision. In no other way could the workman be secure from
molestation if he voted in opposition to his employer's wishes; in no other way
could the shop-keeper feel himself clear of the     constraining influence of
his wealthier customers; in no other way could the tenant feel certain that he
would not draw down on his head the wrath of his landlord, whose intimate friend
or political hero, he might wish to  vote against.
      
<br /><br />   ...again and again it had been debated in monster  meetings, but the
government
refused  to include it in the new Bill;  partly  because their
sympathies were opposed to democracy,  and partly because the practice of voting
by secret ballot was not yet adopted by any other   country,  and they thought
that for a small community in an  outlying corner of the world to try any risky
experiment would be unwise and possibly result in the disgrace of those who
brought so radical a measure into legal operation within the staid and
respectable confines of the  British Empire. (!)      
<br /><br />  But the people of Victoria were self-reliant and  ardent.     Little  did
they care what other people had done or  were     doing: the ballot, not the
open one of the United States, but     a  ballot profoundly secret was
absolutely  necessary  if     the  electors  were  to be free to  give  their 
unbiased     voices.       
<br /><br />   At  the  second  reading of the Electoral  Bill  on  18th     December 
1855 Legislative Councillor  William  Nicholson     moved  that &quot;in the
opinion of this House, any new  Electoral  Act  should provide for electors 
recording  their     votes by secret ballot&quot;.p.378.     
</blockquote>   
    The Ballot Act was passed eventually on 29th March 1856 and an 
election soon followed.        
<blockquote>   Never  was an election period known to pass so  quietly;    
on all hands the new Act was declared to have worked most     admirably, and yet
in no community could there have  been     more  cause for agitation and
disorder. Not one  question     but  a whole crop of them were before the 
electors,  and     all  of a kind to deeply touch the feelings of the 
multitude.p.379. </blockquote>    
    Adult  male  suffrage was soon  introduced  and  parliamentary  terms
reduced from 5 to 3 years.         
<blockquote>   Terrible  results  were prophesied by those  whose  views    
were cautious and distrustful of the new theories.  These     fears have proved
unfounded, and the process of  legislation  and of government has been as
orderly  in  Victoria     then  as  before and not less orderly than  in  the 
most     favoured of civilised communities.p.380.        
<br /><br />  The people took a lively interest in public affairs. They     wished a
voice in the management of the State. They  were     resolved to have it. ...
For five or six years mass  meetings were frequent.p.381.        
<br /><br />Mistakes have been made; failings have appeared; but none     of those
gigantic evils have occurred which were foretold     by  many  visitors and by
the English reviews  and  newspapers  which feared the dominance of the masses.
On  the     contrary,  Victoria has, in the main, reaped only  blessings    
from its era of democracy.p.386. </blockquote>
