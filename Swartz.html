 <h2> Democracy or Islam?</h2><br />
  An interview by Age writer Barney Swartz with Geoff Strong(26/7 p6) with Muslim group Hizb ut- Tahrir's Australian leader, Wassim Doureihi, highlights some of the challenges we face from our admission of other cultures into our country. Somewhat naively we have assumed that immigrants would, in a generation or so, all become integrated into our society with only minor and acceptable change. We believed our society was strong and our values well established. Well that's pretty much the way it used to be. But now, think again Australia!<br /><br /> 
  In an article the following day, Professor Dennis Altman of La Trobe University argues that our children should all be educated at primary level in state schools to get used to and to understand other cultures. He points out that the growth of private and home education is increasing the tendency for ghetto development. Noting that ethnic differences have not been a  problem, he draws attention to the new conflict causing attitudes to be found in religion also noting that while post WWII migration has largely followed our falling away from religious observance, there is a new tension in the arrival of Muslim immigrants. We should note however that the tension is caused by fundamentalist attitudes of some Muslim leaders, who are now openly defying our democratic culture. How far and to what degree these attitudes are embraced by most Muslims is a matter for conjecture, but the main problem is that with the authoritarian nature of Islam that cannot be assessed with any accuracy.<br /><br />
The more militant in Islam are bent on the re-establishment of the Caliphate - an Islamic state from Indonesia to Spain. We should not underestimate their determination. However we must also realise that the Muslim world has much to be aggrieved about with their experience of the 'Christian'  West from the Crusades to Palestine. Mr. Doureihi sees the involvement of the West as a 'campaign against Islam which is political, economic, ideological and military' which justifies Islamic violence in defence of invaded territories.   <br /><br /> 
 Islam has no time for democracy. Although its benefits suit them as a minority, its in an Islamic state
