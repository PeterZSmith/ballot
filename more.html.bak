<H3>Yes, this party is different!</H3>
It represents no-one but the people at large, seeks no advantage for its members other than the chance to make a 
profound change in the way we are governed, advancing to a much better, and 
truer democracy.<br /><br />
With an (electronic) secret-voting system in each 
parliament, all members will be equal, and independent. They will elect (and 
reject) ministers, as they choose.<br /><br />
During debate, preliminary and progressive ballots will be quite feasible, to facilitate the decision-making 
process. But every debate will be finally settled by a concluding ballot, after 
the motion: "That the question now be put" is passed. <br /><br />
The new parliament will be notable for its businesslike approach with quiet, polite, and intense 
objectivity.<br /><br />
With all members equal and independent, they will have no party advantage over other candidates at the next election, and will be 
assiduous in liaising with their constituents in regular public meetings . Thus a new breed of representation and community access will quickly arise. <br /><br />
<H4>Time for action - membership</H4><br />'There are ... many who care, very few who take action.'<br /><br />People say all the time. "The Secret Ballot in Parliament is a great idea, but it will never happen!" <br /><br />
That is quite true if, and only if, we do not take the small step of each being a party member 
- no fee and  involvement optional.<br /><br />
Why does government do what it does? Because it can! Because we let it. <br /><br />
People say "But I can't do anything." <br />
<STRONG>But you, with a growing number of others, can. </STRONG><br /><br />
With a few more members we can achieve more publicity.<br /> With five hundred members we can register, and candidates can stand for this reform. <br />With candidates standing we will see a big following.<br /> With that following we will see the impossible becoming achievable. <br />With a few members at the start, the 
impossible will start to happen.<br /><br />
There's no doubt about it.</B><br /><br />This party is not proposing policies - it's aim is a return 
to a real democracy - with the people, their representatives and parliaments, regaining their proper role 
and authority.<BR><br /><br />
So, what is to be done?<BR>Membership is free for the first hundred applicants, (nothing to do) just by supplying full name and 
street address details of their registration with the Electoral Office (PO Box 
numbers not valid). <br /><br />That is all - at the beginning. When it becomes 
exciting - as we start with a few - then more and more!</A> <br /><br />We can do 
it. So let's just go for it - say YES!-
