<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Being, like many, mostly oblivious to politics, the dismissal of the
Whitlam government in November 1975 was a startling event. I remember exactly
where I was standing when I heard the news. I <em>was</em> startled! However
the incident triggered thoughts about our political life and system. We were
aware that there were some Coalition Senators who were not happy about the
action being taken by the party leadership, preventing the Senate vote on the
Supply Bill. The question arose in the minds of some of us: What would have
been the result if the matter had been put to a secret ballot in the Senate? </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>That question then raised another. Immediately it seemed obvious
that all voting in parliaments should be on the basis of the secret ballot; to
free Members from being forced to vote in accordance with the dictates of their
parties, or other group pressures. Why not? Why not indeed? Could there be a
better democracy than the one we are used to? We soon became convinced that
there could be - that what we have is not really democracy at all. In that case
what we have is not good enough. Could it be that the serious concerns of the
people emanate from a basic problem leading to a well-justified disillusionment
with our political process - our style of democracy? </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>The Greeks seemed to have a happy system in which the citizens could
be directly involved in the public meetings they held to make their political
decisions. To this they gave the name of democracy, based on the two Greek
words <i>demos</i>, 'the people' and <i>kratein</i>, 'to rule'<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn1' href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[i]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
They apparently thrived under their system, enjoying the normal opportunity to
take part, as individuals, in the settling of the policies and decisions that
shaped their lives. Thus their system enabled them, as a people, to grow in
strength, a further sense included in the word <em>kratein.</em></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>At the time they said that it was called a democracy because the
decisions were 'made by the many rather than the few'. It has been commented
(critically, defensively) that slaves got no vote! But that is a red herring.
The significant matter for our analysis is that the entire franchise had the
right of direct input. That is the relevant comparison. We have no significant
input to political decisions. Our 'democracy' is therefore leagues away from
the Athenian model and that is where our 'democracy' fails the test -
miserably. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Western nations are generally regarded as democracies. But Abraham
Lincoln defined democracy as:</span></p>

</span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN-GB>Government OF the people.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Do we have government BY the people?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do we have the opportunity to enter directly into the
political decisions with which we must live? No, we, as individuals, have
merely token involvements, only being permitted to elect representatives, not
vote on issues. So far so good; that is, if the representatives were to
represent us. But the growth of the overwhelming power of the major parties has
destroyed representation of the people.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>The odds are stacked against us having any part in the political process,
let alone exercising a rightful role in self-government. Letters to newspapers
mostly find the 'circular file'; and, in any case, how many take notice of
them, even if they are printed? Even those who take note of them are, mostly,
just isolated individuals. And if a follow up letter is offered the papers
regard the persistence as a cheap advertising campaign and print no more. They
thus control public discussion and debate.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It is said that every letter published equals a hundred
voters. However most letters are not printed. Without the confidence that our
concerns will be heeded, how can anyone feel that it is worthwhile? There is a
considerable sense of ineffectiveness apart from a few brave souls who soldier
on &#8211; usually to the amusement of others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The whole process greatly discourages hope - and participation. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>And what is the effect on the system of talkback programmes? Who
listens?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is this
type of programme any more than a commercial gimmick to enhance the station's
image without conferring any actual democratic benefit - no substance, only
shadow. Talkback hosts are good at 'steamrolling' any input with which they
disagree. So they also control public debate. Again, petitions to Parliament
are routinely ignored - merely recorded. Once again we see tokenism. But
perhaps these criticisms are unfair. Perhaps they are real attempts, if largely
unsuccessful, to fill the gap in people involvement which our political system
is simply incapable of filling. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Parties and pressure groups dominate the political system. There is
no forum for the individual. The forum, which the Athenian enjoyed at the
inception of the whole idea of democracy, has been stolen from the people, and
the people who have stolen it are glad for the people to be led like sheep. For
them, our (or rather their) political system<em> is</em> already a democracy -
no change is needed. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>One TV commentator referred, in an international hook-up, to our
'full-blown' democracy! When a flower is full-blown, the next thing is, of
course, for it to fall apart. Perhaps the comment was prophetic! </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>For the concerned individual, it is an uphill battle against
frustration and helplessness. And when one hears from a New South Wales
Independent that he suffered from acute frustration for years in his parliament
trying to get something done about any problem, we can know that our
'democracy' is far from well. And<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the Opposition, of whichever, and whatever it may consist, is totally
defeated in hoping for agreement by the 'government' on any crucial matter - regardless
of how sane it might be. These things ought not to be. We have lost the real
advantages that a genuine democracy would give us. We have gone backwards, not
forwards, since the days of Greek democracy. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Now, the Communists also claimed that their system was the true
democracy. One remembers the Russian officer in Afghanistan when facing a
German correspondent. He questioned him: &quot;From the <i>Democratic</i>
Republic of Germany?&quot; Karl Marx invented the term, the 'dictatorship of
the proletariat', meaning, one may suppose, the rule of the people. It was a
reaction to the perceived injustice of the political and industrial climate of
his day, when many were suffering at the hands of the 'capitalists'. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>What went wrong? Something certainly did. A 'dictatorship of the
proletariat' could sound a bit like a democracy. But was it? Clearly it was not
- the Communist Party grabbed the power. Revolution is cruel - sudden change.
Democracy is change by evolution - measured, considered change - based on
participation of the governed. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Groups, which form in society, are free to take charge and act
without regard for others. They then take advantage of the lack of political
power of the unorganised. It has been said that people should organise - if
they don't it's their own fault. But what sort of a people do we want to be? An
aggressive society is the antithesis of democracy, which is based on the idea
of mutual regard in a unified community, with the opportunity to be involved,
but not wanting undue advantage. Democracy is based on the idea of equality,
the 'fair go'- a respect and regard for others. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Humankind is often aggressive and there is nothing wrong with that
when it is directed toward penetrating the barriers of the unknown and the
never conceived. Scientists are aggressive in that sense. So are those who aim
to break sporting records, inventors and entrepreneurs in every field. They are
leaders. We need that kind of 'aggression' to improve our democracy, breaking
new ground, inventing better ways for the people to participate in
self-government, without partisanship. We need change in our democracy &#8211; an
upgrade!</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>The principle of mutual respect is essential for democracy. Group
formation and the pushing for sectional advantage are, on the contrary, based
on selfishness, greed and fear. Such attitudes are foreign to real democracy.
While 'the people' are the true and ultimate source of power, there is normally
a progressive deterioration in the access of people to the 'levers' (Keating's
term) through which power is exercised. Should there be these levers? Doesn't
that idea suggest political power - the power of the people, stifled after the
election - transferred to the 'politicians'? </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Parliament should be the 'melting pot', for all ideas to simmer, if
necessary, until satisfactory solutions are found. But it has been short
circuited by the failure of politicians to do the very thing for which they are
elected - to represent the people. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Should we be disturbed? Fresh dangers are looming and without a
realistic forum for the people to have their rightful role in the decisions of
government we are in a parlous state. The world is a dangerous place; and is
worsening rapidly. There may well be happenings over which we will have little,
if any control, but for us to come to the place of acceptance of the
unavoidable we must, as individuals, at least be able to be involved in the
decisions about the serious problems which are going to affect our lives.
Without that we are indeed to be pitied - sheep driven to the shearing shed -
or the abattoirs. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Democracy was never easy. Freedom from dominion has always been
costly. Think about our origins in the 1850s when the people asserted
themselves after the miners died in the struggle against an intolerable regime<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn2' href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[ii]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
Perhaps our state is too tolerable. The danger is that, like Hitler Germany, by
the time it becomes intolerable, our responses may be entirely atrophied - just
like the frog sitting in a container of cold water on the stove, slowly coming
to the boil, but not noticing the growing heat, until too late! What a
terrible, sadistic experiment! </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Letters to the papers, talk back programmes etc. have their place,
but maybe we are just too timid to face our representatives, not with
hostility, but with penetrating questions? But will they listen - with real
ears? Can even aggressiveness succeed? </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Is democracy a hopeless dream? In the East their hopes collapsed in
a fireball of fighting and trouble, and we in the West have so many problems
that we can hardly spare any useful time or thought for the world, much less to
show them a better way. We haven't found it ourselves - despite the fact that
we have the British heritage of parliamentary democracy, enhanced by our own
unique contribution - the secret ballot for <i>elections</i>. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Perhaps the reality of democracy can only be realised in the pursuit
of community objectives, the betterment of society; the never-ending dream. The
need is for a structure in which a vibrant people can confidently operate
together, at will. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Our democracy is sick. There are many who just don't want positive
change. It suits their ambitions the way things are. There are some who want to
regress - with voluntary voting for example. For the 'hoi polloi' to 'drop off'
will suit them better. Some admit that it is not perfect, but excuse any
reluctance for reform, by saying that our system is better than many others.
One Left-wing union activist shocked me, saying, &quot;We need leadership, not
democracy.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Leadership
divorced from the people, even if temporarily, is dictatorship.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Since the Christian church can't see eye to eye, is it any wonder
that many Christians still support groups of entrenched authority pursuing
sectional advantage. Are they interested in a real democracy, with people being
recognised as all equal in the sight of God? Even Machiavelli knew that 'the
voice of the people is the voice of God'. Democracy is surely the expression of
God's will in the area of political life. And Christ washed the disciples' feet
to show His views on personal power and status. True Christianity must surely
approve and foster enhanced democratic procedures and be in the forefront where
democratic reform is needed. Christians led the fight against slavery, child
labour and other abuses in the past. Why not again? Where are we who believe in
the equality of all before God? Is God unconcerned with ordinary life? </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>But where is God? Who is He? I am reminded of the story of Lord
Shaftesbury, visiting the slums with a minister of religion. The minister: &#8220;Why
doesn&#8217;t God do something?&#8221; To which Lord Shaftesbury replied: &#8220;He <i>is.&#8221;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i>And promptly<i> </i>went and
organised a food supply. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Democracy still eludes us. We need leaders to guide us successfully
into the complexities of the future, even to exercise a moral authority that we
can follow. But our political system causes a remoteness of the people from the
leadership, which does not promote total honesty on their part - nor a public
spirit in the people. We must cut loose from the institutionalised problems
that are against our best interests as a people. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Obviously, the easy way to protect the status quo is to call it
democracy. That automatically discredits any suggestion for a better way. There
are some who are seeking to tinker with the system at the edges to improve it,
but without getting to the root of the problem. Cosmetic change merely defers
attention to the real problem. The door is wide open for groups to organise and
capture power from the people. Power must belong to the whole, not to parties
groups and factions. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>The purposelessness of parliament was shown in stark relief when Ian
Sinclair stated in an interview on the Channel 2, Seven Thirty Report:
'Parliament's function is <em>politics </em>(i.e. a public stage for the
jousting of the major parties - the rival 'management' teams). The Constitutional
Convention was different. Why? The reason is plain. The Convention existed to
make a decision. Parliament does not. This was made clear in Mr. Sinclair's
comments to Kerry O&#8217;Brien. The Convention decisions, of course, were made by
ballot, not by 'divisions'. Divisions in parliament do not make decisions -
they are merely a public declaration of decisions made elsewhere. Sadly enough
Ian Sinclair's high reputation, gained as chairman of the Constitutional
Convention, plummeted on subsequently taking the Speaker's Chair in the rowdy
party politics of Parliament. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Can we be satisfied with anything less than a real democracy?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If we had a real one would there be the
apathy, the cynicism, and the poor opinion of politicians.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously we need a new, a real,
democracy. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>Do
we have government BY the people? We have very little say at all. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>Do
we have government FOR the people? Ask the unemployed, the sick. <br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do we have
government OF the people?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ask the
victims of violence. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Trenchant criticism of our political system is quite common, but
those directly involved have no desire to change it. Some, comparing our way of
life with others, think we have arrived. Why then are we in such a mess? Is
there no hope of a better political system, which can help us to resolve our
problems in a much calmer, more sensible, and more effective way? If we can't,
with all our natural advantages, who can? Or could it be that our comparative
wealth is a hindrance to our making progress to a much better democracy?
Countries with far less, are putting us to shame in the economic area where we
are seriously failing. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>On the other hand there are countries that are suffering continually
with much worse problems than ours. A major difficulty for such countries, torn
by factional strife, is the lack of an example of a real democracy, which could
enable them to have some hope of climbing out of their political, social and
economic mess. Our system fails miserably to handle the comparatively trifling
problems that we face. They, and we, need a much better system. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Democracy has yet to prove itself - to prove itself capable of
handling the problems of the present, let alone the future. The clash is
between autocratic styles of government, whose only interest in people is their
vote, caring little for the unorganised, the weak and the disadvantaged. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Real democracy means the devolution of power to the people. But
autocratic systems and more disciplined people are often more successful, while
we are in the doldrums. Why? Does it mean that democracy is not up to it? No,
it means that we don't yet have the essence of democracy as described above. We
have allowed our birthright - the birthright of political freedom - to be
stolen from us. We have mistaken <i>laissez faire</i> and abdication of
responsibility for freedom. Freedom, at any level, is costly. It does not
happen by accident. Political freedom is no different. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Our economy is in deep trouble. We need a new era of very alert and
cooperative effort or we will be left far behind. Successful countries are
those that have found the secret of cooperation between government, industry
and people. But our style of government matches our predilection for conflict,
in sport, in our courts, in our parliaments, in our homes, and sometimes, in
our streets. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Our political system is a constant battleground; vastly entertaining
for a few, no doubt, but little help in the successful resolution of our
long-neglected problems. We certainly need a new democracy - to resolve the
increasingly difficult problems, and to get us out of the economic inertia and
mire into which we have drifted - a new democracy, which can create a new
climate of cooperation, people involvement, decisiveness, and openness to
innovation. There is a fast-changing world rushing upon us, whether we like it
or not. We don't have much time.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Current versions of 'democratic' government throughout the world,
whether modelled on the Westminster, or the American presidential systems, have
clearly demonstrated that they cannot achieve the democratic ideal of fair and
just government, in a climate of reasonable calm. 'Democratic' governments,
even in the most stable of societies, are generally seen by their citizens to
be inept and/or favouring some groups more than others. The resulting
restlessness and distrust often lead to strong dissident action, which may well
end in violence and then be met by severe, repressive measures. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>We see constituents ignored between elections, and a pandering to
the 'hip-pocket nerve' at elections. The way is wide open to abuse, and those
with money and media power can override the weak, and unorganised, with
relative impunity. Self-interest is at a premium, with the public interest at a
discount. The message is loud and clear, and being heeded by more and more
groups; organise, grow strong, and exert pressure until demands are met. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>There are hard decisions to be made. But the people, especially all
those who wish, must be more able to be involved in them. Overruling the people
produces a sullen unwillingness to cooperate, manifesting itself in all kinds
of evil - tax avoidance, profiteering, poor productivity, absenteeism,
excessive wage demands, strikes, pickets, youth unrest, poor education
performance, family turmoil, resort to drugs and crime, widespread depression,
and suicide; with vandalised public assets, rubbish in our streets, and little
pride in our country. Sport alone thrives as a national inspiration. If it
means something to be Australian, why is it that no one expects that spirit to
pervade political life? </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>There are many symptoms of a grievance against a society which
excludes the vast majority from the basic right and satisfaction of a truly
free people - that of participating in the decisions which affect us all -
self-government. If democracy means anything at all, it must mean something
much nearer an equality of power for all persons, than exists at present,
regardless of any lack of wealth and/or organisational clout. Those in power,
who claim we are a democracy, should be willing to give realistic attention to
political reforms giving promise of devolution of power, to make the political
system more accessible and closer to the democratic ideal. But are they? Some
people prefer the democracy we have to a real democracy. Self interest and the
desire for power quickly demolish principle. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>A Russian commentator once made the rueful comment that democracy
never comes from the 'Top'. What's new? Democracy has never been, and never
will be, produced or improved except by the efforts and sacrifice of ordinary
people. Can our 'democracy' guide us through the new challenges of our time?
Unless its processes can deal adequately with the increasing problems of the

action', and their grapeshot has already been making havoc of the 'rigging'!
Let's face it; government is now virtually helpless to stall the economic
invasion - like King Canute's attempt to stop the tide. It is rapidly becoming
very plain that the old contests, within a much more closed system, have now
become an impossible luxury. 'Gladiatorial combat' on the floor of parliament
has now become ludicrous in its stupidity.<span style="mso-spacerun:

on a roll, and those who love its local application will soon feel its power as
the world turns up the economic heat on us. With the tide of global change
swamping us, there can only be one answer. We must continue to urge for an
objective, cooperative style of government; based on non-party politics - like
a wartime government. Now, we are at war as a nation, in a global economic
battlefield. We can no longer pretend to ourselves that we are the masters of
our fate. We have to play the game with the cards we have, with rules made by
others. We are being forced to grow up. Many will suffer. But that could be
minimised by a national, cooperative approach. We can do this, if we wake up
and face facts as they are, instead of hoping they will change to suit us. </span></p>

lang=EN-GB>A lady with a UK accent called on 'open line', wanting to know why
we are so apathetic - why we are not upset with the actions and standards of
politicians, and other people with power over our lives: e.g. the profit-greedy
banks? It's a good question. Is it because so many of us have our own homes,
families, sport, television and entertainment of all kinds? Are we too well off
to be worried? Do we overestimate our security, economic and otherwise? Are we
too self-indulgent to care? Or are we completely satisfied with the political life
of this country? Do we want a better democracy so that we can register a
protest about things that concern us; have some control over our lives, without
the confrontation of angry, shouting demonstrations? Is there any other way? Or
doesn't it matter? Do we think things will just work out OK, without any
protest or other action on our part? Will they?? Really?? </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Do we have a say? What's gone wrong with us? We seem to have given
up. It seems all too hard! Let's satisfy ourselves with sport, entertainment, and
a semi-oblivion with alcohol (not to say drugs). So, it seems, many of us
think. In the mid 1800's (the time of the Eureka Stockade<sup>2</sup>, they
refused to bow down.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>The great Australian apathy no doubt does have its roots in a high
degree of economic well being (except for some, especially of late). But that
is not to say that there is little or no concern; far from it. The tendency of
many to major on self-interest must be seen, at least in part, as a result of
not being able to usefully affect the political process. Helplessness redirects
attention to personal objectives. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>The function of government is to resolve differences in the
community, promoting cooperative community effort. The present system however
does not lead to consensus but, by default and example, causes and encourages
the conflict, the cynicism, and the apathy. Communal harmony and well being
depend on the fairness of the decisions made. So, when difficult decisions to
be made are controversial, harmony will always depend heavily on the fairness
of the process by which they are made. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>For a country to mature and prosper there is a serious need to
achieve a new unity of purpose for the solution of those stubborn problems that
hinder national progress and well being. But this implies a high degree of
community cooperation, which is beyond our capacity under the existing
political system. Real unity requires the possibility of direct involvement in
the political process, for all who wish it, no matter how little that
contribution may be. For the 'silent majority', isolated as we are from
effective involvement in political decisions, politics is virtually a taboo
subject. Such discussion gets us nowhere; it is too frustrating and even
painful. People hate politics. It just makes people angry. Why? Because we can
only make a noise and get upset - we cannot change anything. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>The low regard in which politicians&#8217; are held, is indisputable
evidence of the frustration of the community with the conduct of government,
which holds at arms-length the very people to whom it should be accountable.
There is distrust and hostility toward authority, and a level of concern that
does not augur well for future community well being and harmony. And we should
also be near to panic with the spate of suicides, murders, child molestation
and abuse, assaults and crimes of all sorts, not to mention addiction of so
many to drugs, often followed by mental disease.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>The present agenda for the pursuit of individual rights reflects
fear of government. It stems from a disbelief in the possibility of a truly
democratic system of government which can be fair to all, and from which all
can benefit by belonging. And this climate of danger from government, or
failure of government to protect the well being of its citizens, is associated
with the absence of an evident accountability to the people. Such fears plainly
indicate a deficiency in our democracy. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>The power to throw out the government at election time, and replace
it with another, is a power to punish but little power to improve matters. A
real democracy must be able to do much better than the see-saw style of
governments we now have, with its longer term instability and extreme policy
shifts driven by competing ideologies. </span></p>

instead of a quick response from an adequate staff. Taped responses are both a
hindrance and insulting. Apparently modern technology cannot even inform us
where we stand in the caller queue! The minutes we waste, and the frustration
we experience, add to consumer costs, while the profits of the 'efficient

<P>
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>There was a period in early Victoria, (in the 1850s), called the '<b>Era
of Democracy</b>'<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn3' href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[iii]<![endif]></span></span></a>. It
started with unrest on the gold fields, where many restless and fiercely
independent immigrants, who had dreams of great riches, did not strike much
gold. The harsh and ill-conceived miners' licence fee - a hefty
thirty-shillings-per-month (probably a month's wage, at least) - with a fine of
five pounds for failure to produce a licence - proved the last straw. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>At Ballarat, Victoria, hundreds of miners took up arms against the
government, raising the blue flag with the white cross, now a familiar sight
hanging from cranes on city building sites. The British military attacked in an
action known as the <b>'Eureka Stockade'</b>. In the early morning of Sunday,
3rd. December 1854, some twenty miners died in an easily crushed rebellion. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>The incident was followed by a period of considerable political
activity. Public meetings abounded, with some numbering as many as ten thousand
men, and such was the antagonism toward the Colonial authorities and clamour
for democratic reform that Juries declared all the captured rebels 'not
guilty'. </span></p><P>

 <FONT SIZE="+2"><CENTER><B>The Chartists.</B></CENTER>  </FONT><P>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>At least half the population were new immigrants who, being without
the qualifying land holding, had no vote. Amongst these must certainly have
been<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the Chartists, a group
of political activists who had been agitating for some time in England for
improvements to the English political system. Their list of reforms included
the requirement that the election of Members of Parliament be conducted by
secret ballot. Other reforms being sought included the abolition of the
property qualification for Members of Parliament, adult (male at that time)
suffrage, and short (term) parliaments. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Following hot public debate the Victorian Parliament reluctantly
adopted these reforms. Perhaps the most important to be adopted was the <b><i>secret
ballot</i></b><i> </i>for the election of Members of Parliament - against the
wishes of the conservative minority in the community, and the (limited
franchise) government. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>It was noted at the time that the employee would no longer have to
look over his shoulder to see if his employer was watching the way he was
voting. The shopkeeper and the tenant were likewise now free to cast their
votes without fear, from customer or landlord. It would be utterly intolerable
for us to return to the situation that existed before this change. Yet it is
easy for us to take for granted that which was only achieved by much agitation
and loss of life. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>At that time the opponents of the secret ballot forecast that its
adoption would result in chaos. Such is the reaction of those with an ingrained
hostility toward change, regardless of the need. But the record indicates that there
was complete calm in the aftermath of the subsequent election, despite the fact
that a great many controversial questions were in issue at the time. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>This is not really so surprising, as we now know well that the use
of the secret ballot ends all argument. It is manifestly the fairest way for
differences of opinion to be settled when decisions must be made. Imperfect as
our electoral system is, it is clear that there is a far more equal say in
elections with the ballot than without. And the calm acceptance of the result
of elections by ballot is a repeated phenomenon, no matter how close the
winning margin. Its fairness guarantees a universal acceptance on the basis of
majority rule. But one problem with a rule by a majority of seats is that it is
often not accompanied by an overall majority of votes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>On 3rd. December 1991, the 137th anniversary of the Eureka
rebellion, historian Brian Mckinlay was speaking on Australia's <i>Radio
National</i>. He commented that the results of Eureka were to make Victoria the
leader in the vanguard of the world's modern democracies. In fact it is
understood that in America the secret ballot for elections is sometimes
referred to as<b> </b>'the Australian Ballot'!<b> </b></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>To live in a country with a government genuinely reflecting the
views of an involved and caring community, could only be seen as an altogether
new dimension of life. A real quality of life has much deeper roots than a mere
quest for material things, but the <i>material</i> and the <i>macho</i> are
deeply ingrained in our society, and in this regard our political system has a
case to answer. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>We need a new<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>basis of ongoing opportunity for the participation of the public.
Periodic voting in <i>pork-barrel</i> contests between rival parties is no
democracy. This is a 'least-worst' choice which produces our feeling of
helplessness, apathy and, sometimes, fury. </span></p>

<p>  To be able to have some say in resolving the problems would, in
itself, even without any prospect of immediate material gain, constitute an
unimagined improvement in the quality of life of the community. The importance
of each of us having an effective opportunity to join in, at will, with
discussions on matters of concern, with an actual impact on the decision-making
process, cannot be measured. A pipe dream? Perhaps. Utopian? Yes. Idealistic?
Of course. Every advance grows from an ideal. Without ideals to pursue we slide
backwards. We never just stand still. 'Where there is no vision, the people
perish'. 

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>We cannot be proud of our country if justice and fairness are not seen
to be the norm. Even where justice is present, but not clearly apparent, peace
and harmony will continue to elude. It is therefore not hard to see why
minorities are restless, aggressive, and violent, in so many places in the
world. Since only justice can create well-being and peace, it is evident that a
basis must be found which is seen to be eminently fair and reasonably prompt in
resolving community concerns. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>To be able to realistically participate - in a modern and complex
world - demands a fundamental change, a radical rethink of the democratic
process. We need a system that will give a much greater confidence in the
processes of government. Such a system must have the least possible hindrance
to individual input. Those in the community who are concerned, a flexible,
open-ended group, should be able to feel that there is no obstacle to an
effective involvement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We cannot
afford to be at ease. There has been a sound political sleep foisted on us by
the political parties over the years. There was a time when we were the 'lucky
country'. That time, (when we had our heads in the sand), is now well past. </span></p>

 <P><FONT SIZE="+2"><CENTER><B>  A New Democracy?</B></CENTER>  </FONT><P>

 
<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Although we live in far different times and circumstances, we have a
vital need to recapture some of the Athenian genius for democracy. To them the
practice of democratic involvement was an important facet of life. The question
is: Is it possible for us, as ordinary people, to have an effective involvement
without a political commitment? It is understandable that the desire and capacity
of different people to participate in any aspect of the political process will
always vary considerably, even should a radical change render the system wide
open to the occasional involvement of the uncommitted citizen. However, the
usual problem is the severe impediment to any realistic involvement by
concerned people, including the frustrations usually suffered by parliamentary
Oppositions and Independents. Real democracy is still ahead of us. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>A successful individual and national effort demands a cooperative
approach in all the various areas of our lives, and it is imperative that that
approach be practised and exemplified in our parliaments. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Successful government depends heavily on the goodwill of the people
- a goodwill that must be based on the right to participate effectively in the
decisions. Decisions are made at present with little real reference to the
public, and the psychological damage to the cooperative will of the people is
unmeasured and immeasurable. It is known intuitively, but is easily disregarded
because real accountability to the people, as under a truly democratic system,
does not exist. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Democracy, as defined by Abraham Lincoln, has always been revered as
the ideal of political life to be aspired to, hoped for, and reached after. Is
the ultimate of pure democracy, with opportunity for involvement, as in Athens,
beyond us? Perhaps more use could be made of referenda for example. But it is
incumbent on us to positively and energetically seek the political system best
able to facilitate self-government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>'The best government is that which teaches us to govern ourselves'. The
governed must be able to participate in government. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Our sham democracy is simply not good enough. We need government
that has the respect of the people - a political process, which will create
government that is seen to be making the right decisions for the right reasons.
Men and women with no political attachment or commitment should feel able to
have some input of opinion with regard to public matters, if they wish.
Democracy cannot survive, let alone become the world norm, unless we undertake
the task of updating and improving our political process; to open the way to an
ability to handle the new and difficult problems the future will bring. That is
the reason we must persist with the dream of a radical change to a cooperative
basis of government based on genuine representation. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>We need an adequate way for ordinary citizens to be able to
participate effectively in political discussion as an integral part of the political
decision-making process, but without the need, or any advantage, in being
committed to a political organisation. At the same time we need a way for <i>our
Representative</i> to relate, and to be really accountable, to the people in
the electorate, in a more immediate way between elections. Our representative
needs to be freed from the responsibility of defending a party image, to be a
genuine representative, building a relationship of trust with constituents
through regular public meetings. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>There is also a need for a new way for alternative candidates to
arise and be seen effectively challenging the representative, in the period
between elections, should the representative fail in the duty of representing
the constituents in an adequate way. This could only be expected to happen in
such meetings. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>We need parliaments that can be recognised as non-partisan; fair and
just in their decision-making, and clearly operating in the public interest.
Such parliaments could have much better backing of the people in<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>making<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
so-called 'tough decisions'. There would, most certainly, not be the enmity and
hostility that the present system creates. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-GB>Can these aims be achieved concurrently? Is it a hopeless dream?
