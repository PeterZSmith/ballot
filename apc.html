<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>'Compulsory Voting' </b></font></p>

<p>1.There are some who wish to destroy the democratic safeguards
of our election process - the secret ballot and 'compulsory
voting'; together comprising an election process which is a world
leader. 'Compulsory Voting' is a misnomer. The law requires
everyone to attend and receive a voting paper. The compulsory
aspect is therefore to attend the poll on the day or make other
arrangements to vote by postal or absentee vote. The law cannot
compel an actual vote by reason of the secrecy of the voting
procedures.</p>

<p>2.The push for voluntary voting is specious and, at this
point, quite insidious, voluntary voting for delegates having
been included by the government in its proposals for the 1999
Constitutional Convention. The proposal was by a South Australian
Senator in whose state this is the practice apparently.</p>

<p>3.There is a danger that ignorance of the great value of this
law could lead to its overthrow. For example, a comment on radio:
'compulsory voting' should go - it is outdated.' Far from being
'outdated', the 20th century introduction of 'compulsory voting'
in Australia is a modern and vital ingredient of our system,
rather than evidence of democratic fault. The fact that this
procedure is relatively rare in the world means we are not bound
by other traditions, but are leading the way, as we did with the
introduction of the secret ballot for elections. To mistake our
leadership on this issue as being out of step with the rest of
the world, and therefore wrong, is to display considerable
ignorance of our history and the meaning and nature of democracy;
revealing probable leanings toward elitism and autocracy or plain
ignorance.</p>

<p>4.Democracy means 'government by the people', and anything
that helps people to be involved in the decisions which affect
them, even at this small level, is valuable for upholding our
democratic heritage. Conversely, anything which discourages
involvement must be viewed as inimical to the interests of the
people. The trip to the polling booth is marked by a quiet
friendliness between rival candidates representatives, and among
voters, (even though they know that the next person could be
voting contrariwise). It is one of the rare, unifying community
experiences - another virtue of the secret ballot - we are all
equal at the poll. The secret ballot poll creates democracy.</p>

<p>5.While the value of people's votes may well vary, that in no
way negates the value of any individual's votes. There is benefit
in every person taking a conscious part, (be it ever so small),
in terms of a closer unity. Similarly the outcome of an election
is interesting to all and, apart from any challenges to the
conduct of the poll, there is a complete acceptance of the
outcome, because all have been involved. But release of the legal
obligation to attend the poll would most likely see a gradual,
but substantial, fall-off in voting.</p>

<p>6. To make this matter an issue of 'freedom' is a serious
misunderstanding; release from a worthwhile obligation is not the
way to freedom. Should we make education optional? Or road rules?
The requirement to attend the polling booth is an opportunity to
be involved in the public matters which affect us all rather than
an encroachment on liberty - an opportunity to grow as members of
a civilised community. </p>

<p>7.Those decrying the system of 'compulsory voting' apparently
believe that the votes of the less-committed, and less-informed,
distort the election result, and that the idea does not lead to
the best kind of government which, presumably, means government
by the intellectual and the wealthy - the few - the oligarchs.
This is not the accepted recipe for good government. The more
people take part, the better are the decisions made. That's a
simple fact. It is democratically constructive and energising for
the people to all take part. It is democratically destructive and
politically damaging to discourage participation. </p>

<p>8.Self-government enables government with a minimum of
compulsion, because it majors on participation and willing
cooperation. The participation of all heightens the legitimacy of
government, lessening reasons for not accepting and being bound
by the decisions of government. It is therefore important that
all should have this minimum basic input to the process of
government; i.e. to be involved in the election of those with the
responsibility of representing them. No person is totally devoid
of the ability to make a judgment as to the suitability of a
candidate for election, especially if there can be fair
competition between candidates and accurate information about all
of them - matters that do need attention. That the judgment of
some voters may not be 'good' in the eyes of others is totally
irrelevant. </p>

<p>12.A further danger of removing the duty to vote appears to
lie in the style of electioneering which that removal could
introduce. Elections are far too much involved with money, and
the image and style of leaders, and too little to do with an
information-based appraisal of individual candidates and the
issues involved. Instead, removing this duty would open a wider
door for money, razzmatazz, marches with bands (to get out the
partisan vote), conventions, exciting rallies, and political
hype, and see our future even more dominated by parties and other
political groups.</p>

<p>10.To end 'compulsory voting' would be a retrograde step in
the building of a democratic community. The Greek attitude to the
community is the very thing we have left too far behind. The lack
of such a unifying community attitude could be associated readily
with the major problems in our society - and our world.</p>

<p>13.Perhaps governments here should be aware that in the USA
(which is one of the many that do not have 'compulsory voting'),
there is concern at the low voter turnout and a keen interest in
our good poll participation, resulting from the enlightened laws
of our Federation Fathers. In an international internet hookup
American analysts were surprised to hear that the Australian
public does not hate voting, but is happy to do its bit to foster
better government. </p>

<p>14.We must not agree to abandoning compulsory attendance at
the poll. There are reasons why some people are less informed
and/or show a lack of interest and committment. Without a doubt,
the existing system is to blame for the boredom with 'politics',
and the disrespect for the electoral process. Far from being
concerned about good democratic government, the call for an end
to 'compulsory voting' implies satisfaction with the existing
corrupt system, and a desire to disfranchise the disenchanted. </p>

<p align="left"><b>The Kids should not vote!</b></p>

<p align="left">15.In a sour news article<font size="1"><sup>20</sup></font>,
Tim Ferguson, author of 'Left,Right &amp; Centre'), accuses the
'Kids' of 'too much sex, too little sense', to be able to vote
intelligently. This is just another shot in Nick Minchin's war
against the inclusion of 'the common people' in the political
process. It should not be forgotten that the <em>privilege</em>
of voting was extended to the over 18-year-olds as a result of
the call up of this age group for service in Vietnam, and
government embarrassment about the odious policy of conscription.
</p>

<p align="left">16.If the young are seen as not being able to
vote with great intelligence whose fault is that? Governments
have been loath to upgrade the understanding of the people by
suitable educational opportunities. Where did the Civics studies
go? Why aren't political studies made core subjects? Does our
standard of 'politics' have the approval of the people? Who are
the people who decree that we must stick with a manifestly
undemocratic system of government, like the party system, which
prevents the people from having a significant part in the
process? When the 'mature' are effectively disfranchised,
resentful and cynical about government, is it any wonder <em>if </em>the
young don't care? Who can be politically competent when we have
no say in what goes on? Let's have enough of this cynical
attitude toward the young, and ordinary folk in general. Let's
look instead at our faltering 'democracy'. </p>

<p>18.There is no doubt that a greater participation of the
comunity in discussion and debate would greatly enhance the
democratic process with better government and community well
being. We therefore need to marry the success of the 'compulsory
vote' with a greater ability for the 'man-in-the-street' to
participate in the decision-making process, in non-partisan
public meetings. In that way, there will be a dual advantage; a
new confidence to share in the system - because of the option
thus available, and the added ability to form better judgements
of election candidates' ability and suitability. </p>

<p>To abandon compulsory attendance at the poll will lead to more
voter disillusion, cynicism and contempt for 'politics' and
politicians - not to 'freedom. Senator Minchin should be
thoroughly ashamed of himself for touting the idea of relaxing
compulsory attendance at the polling booth. It hurts no one any
more than being obliged by law to drive on the left.</p><P>
