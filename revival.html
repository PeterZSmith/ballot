<h2>National Revival</h2><br /> 
   <strong><h2>There's something missing - What is it?</h2>  <br />  <br />
  
  Both democracy and our society's moral basis need revival, as deterioration is the only constant in all things human. We need revival - in both politics and religion. They are inextricably linked. But Christian politician Wilberforce took forty five years to get slavery banned in Britain.<br /><br />
 
Over the centuries society has been occasionally rescued from that deterioration by outstanding biblical preaching. We need it today, because without such moral challenge the prospect of democratic renewal is just too much for a  population led astray by affluence.<br /><br />
 
  In his book, 'Power from on high', Charles Finney, nineteenth century American evangelist, says:  
  'If immorality prevails in the land (which it certainly does), ... (there follows) a decay of conscience, the public press lacks moral discrimination, the Church is degenerate and worldly, if Satan rules in our halls of legislation, if our politics becomes so corrupt that the very foundations of government are ready to fall away, ... <b>the pulpit is  responsible.</b> <br /><br />
  
  Friends, who can doubt that all this prevails today.<br /><br />
  
  The common view, is  that political reform is too much, too complex. In fact it is neither. The real problem is that people today would simply wilt if faced with the kind of problems our ancestors had to face.We are a spoilt lot and cannot, like some footballers, handle the wealth experience, turning to a destructive self indulgence. <br /><br />

  We badly need a resurgence of self denial and public spirit.<br /> In other words a moral revival.<br /><br />

  
   In fact, we need a revival at all levels of society - urgently. <br /><br />
  
  Australian democracy may be 'the best in the world', with Britain edging towards their Alternative Vote (a virtual copy of our preferential voting). But, democracy like a home or a car, or society at large, is subject to constant deterioration, without constant attention and repair.<br /><br />
  
  We, the people, need to considerably improve our participation in the actual political process - of self government. But how?<br /> <br /> 
  
  The advent of social media has achieved considerable popular involvement, but on the fringe, heightening the frustration of the much better educated populace of recent years. Democracy is not a stationary system of government. It needs constant attention to upgrade the participation of the public by, opening the way for the growing popular education and sophistication to enter into the area of political decisions,  thus defusing the public political frustration by directing its critical faculty into local forums run by the local member, instead of having to rely on the media and parliamentary opposition to control the entrenched power of party government. <br /> <br />
