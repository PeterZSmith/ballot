 There
is generally a very real attachment to the principle of democracy, even though
it may mean different things to different people. But Abraham Lincoln's
oft-quoted definition has a theoretical accuracy that cannot be ignored. True democratic
government must:<P>
<UL>
<LI> represent the people; genuinely, directly; i.e. government <b>BY</b> the people.
when required, be strong, decisive, government; i.e. government <b>OF</b> the
people. <P>
<LI>be just; i.e. government <b>FOR </b>the people.  </UL>

This
ideal looks for an immediacy of effectual public participation in the processes
of government, on the basis that the involvement of the people will produce,
over time, the best answers to the problems we face, for two reasons: </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><![endif]>Because
of 'the many' being involved, the manifest fairness of a truly democratic
system can mean a much greater degree of community acceptance of the decisions
made, with a consequently greater cooperation in their implementation. </p>

 

 <P>And nothing could be
more important for us than cooperation at all levels of government and society
to promote the kind of progress which we need at this juncture in our history,
with all the growing pressures of diplomacy, immigration, trade, international
finance, and technological, agricultural, and environmental challenges, not to
mention the mounting social problems brought on by unemployment and drugs.
Unresolved conflicts in opinions in all these areas can only hinder, even
destroy, this country's chances of a well-ordered, productive and happy
society. <p>
 The crux of the
problem in Western democracies is that it is assumed that we have democracy.
The danger (and the tragedy) is that people engrossed in the existing political
system, see it as the ultimate, and cannot, or will not; see that its faults
demand action. While a pure democracy, in the sense of an equality of personal
political involvement in a large society, is out of the question, the evident
shortcomings should be a matter of real concern to us all. <p>

 Whereas power
belongs to the people, our 'democracy' is almost ludicrous in the puerile
struggles for personal power we see in our politicians. It is good to laugh
sometimes, but 'happiness is no laughing matter', and our need for a real
democracy is serious. Our happiness, our well being depends very much on the
degree of freedom we enjoy from unjust treatment by government, or by others
from whom it is government's job to protect us. Good government is foundational
to society; when that fails what can the people do? <p>
 Democracy is the
government of choice for those who long to be free. Any diminution in its
quality represents (and is caused by) losses of legitimate freedoms. Our well
being, individually and as a nation, is at stake. <p>

 <B><CENTER>Politics</CENTER></B> 

<p>  It is evident that
for democracy to be successful there has to be a democratic attitude in its
conduct, which means the abandonment of force and aggression in favour of
reason and mutual respect. There must be a willingness to rely on the processes
of public persuasion - true politics - which requires the patience that only
comes from goodwill - a 'fair go' for all in other words. Politics is the art
of synthesising the needs and aspirations of the whole community into policies
and action that produce the maximum overall benefit. It comprises the
channeling of public opinions, perceptions and demands through representatives
to their assembly for their deliberation in the manner indicated above. It also
includes the downward communication of alternative and contrary views to the
public. Herein lies a key (and difficult) responsibility of Representatives.
Between parliament and people the best answers must be thrashed out. The media
is prominent in these functions but it is regrettable that face-to-face
discussion between Representatives and constituents has been substantially thus
replaced. Is there a better answer? <p>

 Where the system
does not give full and free scope for the process of rational discussion, the
goodwill of those overruled or ignored can be stretched to breaking point. Some
of the challenges of politics result from the lack of care for minorities by
the majority. The wants of the majority tend to crowd out the woes of
minorities. Do those well off consider the poor? Do the concerns of those who
are fit leave room for the needs of the sick? Do freeways have priorities over
hospitals? Does the current passion for economic efficiency allow room for
understanding the high pressure on nurses and teachers, whose dedication to the
sick and the young is overtaxed to the point of desperation by staff
reductions? Arrogant self-interest has no place in a democracy worthy of the name.
It destroys the very cooperation which, if anything, can reap the rewards which
we would all like to see; both materially and socially. <p>

 The work of politics
is to resolve the problems of united action in a community divided by differing
interests and needs. Where the political system can do that, in a reasonably
calm manner, great benefit accrues to the community. Politics must be an
ongoing, non-stop function, involving as many as can, and wish to, be involved.
It should never be viewed as an occasional opportunity to indulge in the
frenetic activity of the committed at election times - i.e.'politics'. <p>

 The people,
according to the changing circumstances and needs of the community, should
regard all issues as under the possibility of review. The suggestion that old
laws, bad laws, are still 'on the books' means that they are acceptable to the
people is quite false. Whereas politics must beneficially involve the people,
as of democratic right, 'politics' excludes the people and serves the interests
that dominate the political process, as Belloc and Chesterton clearly saw,n their book: 'The Party System' (London, 1911.) 
The people must legitimately feel confidence in the political system; that they
can participate in real self-government. <p>

 <B><CENTER>The Problem of Authority</CENTER></B>.<p>

 

 There is a certain
strain of thinking abroad that democracy is too weak and clumsy for the
effective operation of government. We are quite familiar with the occasional
sour comment that what we need is a dictator. We Australians display little
liking for leaders, who are often inclined to think and act autocratically. But
we do need leadership. How can we get one without the other - strong leadership
without the improper use of powers won under our system of election? Can the
abuse of power be prevented? Is there a way? <p>

 Often a new direction
will be all-important. To see and promote answers to new problems and
opportunities is the true quality of leadership, not necessarily evident in
those with the power to implement. We must learn how each Member of Parliament
can exercise the function of leadership, if able to be freed from party
constraints. Political power and
political leadership must not be regarded as the same thing. Party 'politics'
confuses the two. Political power belongs to the whole Parliament. Initiative
must not be excluded from the Members, as distinct from the executive, or from
the people; according to Belloc and Chesterton. Only a parliament composed
independent, truly accountable representatives can promote among its Members
the real function of non-partisan, issue-based leadership, while retaining the
power of decision for itself. <p>

 Parliament must
acquire the integrity, the credibility, the flexibility, and the strength, to
be able to respond promptly to any situation in the right manner. Machiavelli
was to point out that government must be able to operate with the people as
sovereign in peace but must quickly reclaim sovereignty in emergency. That
demands a dynamic democracy.<p>

 <B><CENTER>Representative Government</CENTER></B> <p>

 Democracy today is
representative government. Hillaire Belloc and Cecil Chesterton spelled out in
1911<sup>2 <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></sup>the following
requirements for government by democratic representation: </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;

constituents and to no one else, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.1in;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo11;
tab-stops:list .35in'><![if !supportLists]>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>The Representatives must deliberate in perfect freedom, and
especially must be absolutely independent of the (Commons) 'Executive'. <p>

 'Instead', they
criticise, 'of the Executive being controlled by the assembly, it (the
Executive) controls it (the Commons).' One could not get a more accurate
description of our House of Representatives' malpractice. On the other hand the
above ideal of representative government certainly seems to be a reasonable
statement of aims for a democracy such as ours; the only question being, 'is it
feasible?' A good question. <p>

 It unfortunately
needs to be said that a Representative's function is to represent the <b><i>people</i></b>
to Parliament - not special interests or ideologies. Sometimes it will be
necessary for a Representative to reason with constituents where convictions
would indicate that the people's views are astray - in other words to represent
Parliament (e.g. the national interest) to the people! <p>

 The essence of
representative government is the close relationship of the Member with the
community. If there is no liaison with the public, representation is a myth. It
is essential to have contact with all opinion and needs in the community to be
able to act representatively in parliament. Minorities must not feel ignored. Democratic
government is FOR (ALL) the people. Even if they cannot have all their wishes
met, they must feel that pursuit of legitimate aims is not hopeless. There is a
lot of discouragement and, indeed, hopelessness about these days, because of
the party system. Representatives need to be delivered from the bondage of
party politics. <p>
 A Representative, if
freed from party control and pressure group interference at the parliamentary
level, would have a high calling indeed, but there could be 'storms' for individual
Members to ride out at the local level. This is an inescapable corollary and
challenge of a truly democratic process of self-government. <p>
 The revival of the
idea of a representative as a 'delegate', is no doubt a reaction to frustration
with party politics and its interference with direct representation, concerns
about the plight of the country, fears for the future, and a felt need to have
a more positive say in the political scene. The delegate view regards the
Representative as a mere 'messenger'. <p>

 While the
electorate's views will undoubtedly, and must, preoccupy the Member's mind, to
be a mere messenger is far below the needs of the country, and of ourselves, as
our long-term well-being is integral with that of our country, and also,
ultimately, that of our world. In a representative democracy, therefore, a
representative is both a listener and a leader in policy formulation on behalf
of the electorate, enhancing the prospects for the realisation of the best
community aspirations. People should be able to feel that nothing is
impossible, so never give up, even though majority opinion may temporarily
defeat sensible, but personal, aspirations. We need representatives who are
'statesmen'. Mere delegates - 'messengers' - cannot be statesmen. <p>

 <B><CENTER>Rights v. Unity</CENTER></B> <p>

 The question of an
individual right must be weighed against the rights of others - the well being
of the whole. Community life requires unity - in the basic and essential
attitudes and practices of life, including language. Government is an essential
factor in our community life. Without government we are not a people. But
without <i>good</i> government we are a troubled people. <p>

 The question of
individual rights requires a refinement of judgment, on the part of government,
which can avoid misapplication of principles and laws to cases for which such
are inappropriate. We must tread gently, lest we tread on 'dreams'! Simplistic,
legalistic answers to problems need to be avoided if we would see real justice
prevail. Good judgment requires that there be real goodwill toward our fellows,
ensuring their dignity and well being. Unless our concept rests in this
framework, the freedom of one will be at the expense of another. . Where
restraints must be imposed, that can be acceptable if the decisions can be seen
to be fairly derived. <p>

 In the community,
the vital need is that self-restraint be exercised willingly for the benefit of
the whole<p>
 We do not want to
see a system of rights which has the effect of supporting an individualism
which is damaging to other people, or to truly accountable government; in other
words, wide-ranging legal restraints, which may prevent good government from
carrying out the majority will of a caring people. The vital need is that we exercise self-restraint voluntarily for
the benefit of the whole. We are already plagued by excessive minority power.
The power to achieve undue personal or minority advantage creates enemies. <p>
 The genius of real
democracy is to limit the use of political power to that which the people
approve. For the system to permit power beyond that is to see peaks of power
and entrenched conflict. Limiting the power of the powerful is a leveling
process, which opens the way for the civilised and civilising function of
genuine politics to cooperatively pursue the cause of justice. Limiting power
excludes tyrants and promotes democratic leadership. Democracy requires a
system that can engender confidence in all individuals, especially in weak and
depressed minorities, that their reasonable interests will be heard and regarded,
while excluding any undue political leverage. Government must control the
strong and by responsiveness give confidence to the weak. <p>

 <B><CENTER>Multiculturalism, or
Cultural Diversity? </CENTER></B>

 'Multiculturalism',
means different things to different people - acceptance of difference with
goodwill for some; or, it may be an ideological drive, with an enthusiastic
embrace of the different for its own sake? People generally have 'absorbed'
cultural diversity, - which is obviously supportable in enriching our community
life; even if it were only for the diversity of food styles that immigrants
have brought with them! <p>

 But governments
granting differential benefits stir the pot. There is a world of difference
between 'allowing', and (governments) 'helping', people to be different.
Culture is a matter for each individual, not for which governments should
undertake responsibility. Australia's welcome to migrants is as individuals not
as members of groups - of any kind. <p>

 Multiculturalism, as
a policy, cannot be taken to mean special privileges; although in our culture
special needs do attract appropriate help, hopefully, independently of cultural
considerations. Surely that should be our aim. </p>

 Multiculturalism is
fine if it means that we have many different people with various cultural
backgrounds, which do not actively threaten existing values, and especially if
they move toward Australian citizenship, not making Australia a stage for
playing out imported antagonisms. Government obligation is to see that nobody
is harassed because of cultural differences. Some differences may be
anti-social; e.g. in South Africa; the Zulu insistence on carrying 'traditional
weapons' in publicly organised fashion. Intimidatory habits brought from less-ordered communities, must be
outlawed. Some non-intimidatory habits may be considered to be a threat to our
Australian cultural values. But if our cultural values are in danger, then we
might reflect how our culture has deteriorated by our own neglect - our own
weakness - not by the immigrant minority. The remedy lies with us. <p>
 Majority Rule <p>

 Some think that
democracy is merely majority rule. The Greeks explained their 'democracy' as
'rule by the many rather than rule by the few'; 'the many' being the entire
franchise, in public forum. <p>

 The term, democracy,
the way they understood it, (and they invented it), is best seen as a contrast
to the norm - rule by dictators, oligarchs, parties, elites, bureaucrats etc.,
none of which is acceptable as democracy. Any political system that excludes
people from an active participation in the making of the decisions that govern
their lives has turned aside from democratic principles. Public apathy in no
way excuses the exclusion of those wanting a greater degree of participation –
government BY the people. <p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.1in'>No true democrat
wants to dominate other peoples' lives. Viewed in this light, Lincoln's third
point - ‘government FOR the people' comes into clear focus. New
governments usually claim that they will govern for <b><i>all</i></b> the
people. This is not to ridicule such claims but to remind us that to give less
than due regard to minority concerns inevitably exacerbates community tensions
through isolation and discouragement.<p>

 In seeking to
understand the nature of democracy we must bear in mind that the people, the majority,
must rule. Otherwise there is minority rule - with the majority held to ransom.
There needs to be a balance. Each Representative must uphold the minority view
where justice so demands, but resist those demands where it does not. Sometimes
the majority view may be unwise or unaware of minority problems, and leadership
will be required to support a minority view. A democratic system should be able
to facilitate the persuasion of a majority to embrace a minority view; wherever
justice leads; without undue difficulty. <p>

 Having the real
power, the majority must be sensitive to the needs and fears of its minorities,
and certainly of the individual as well. Only where there is effectual
opportunity for all concerns to be aired in public face-to-face contacts can
this be. The people must accept responsibility for decisions that may adversely
affect a minority. Without face-to-face contact in regular public meetings it
is difficult to see this occurring. Such facilities work well if convened by
Representatives. <p>
 Parliament must be
able to protect the people from the political muscle of privileged individuals,
or minorities, over the will of the majority; or, vice versa, of the majority
over the legitimate interests of individuals or minorities. Such is government FOR the people; such is
the nature of <i>real</i> democracy. <p>

 <B><CENTER>Unanimity</CENTER></B> <P>

 The Society of
Friends, called the Quakers, follow the practice of unanimity in their
decision-making, not wishing that any member should be overridden. But it is
clear that this, as a rigid practice, would effectively overturn the principle
of majority rule, and thus be quite untenable for the purpose of politics, as a
few could hold the many to ransom. A balance, or compromise, is essential in
weighing the needs and interests of all, because, in government, decisions
cannot be avoided until complete unanimity is reached. <p>

<B><CENTER> A Narrow Majority</CENTER></B><p>

 A question remains
about the acceptability of decisions made on a bare majority. Can such
decisions be stable? War is such a case. Since retreat may well be quite
impractical and unacceptable, very substantial agreement must exist at the
outset. (The Vietnam War was a case in point.) <p>

 Prior to the
implementation of any serious, far-reaching policies it would seem wise to
require a majority which is substantial, and has increased over a period of
discussion and debate; possibly lengthy in controversial cases. There is
nothing to suggest that such a process could not accelerate whenever the need
for decision is urgent. But in many cases we see an autocratic attitude acting
on a so-called mandate and forcing decisions through without heeding the need
for adequate public debate. It happens. It should not.  <P>

 

 
 <B><CENTER>Minorities </CENTER></B><P>

 Mr. Sarkis, when President of
Lebanon, said that the problem of his country was the problem of minorities. It
is equally true of any country, in varying degrees. In many cases, especially
developing nations, their confusion and sufferings are beyond words. Which must
prevail; majority will, minority demand; or conscience?  <p>

 The question arises in these
considerations, as to the nature of the issue refused by a majority or about
which a minority refuses to be overruled. Sometimes a majority will yield for
political reasons when the minority should be resisted, and sometimes the
minority view that should, in all conscience, prevail. <p>

 The minority case may be for a
felt need. On the other hand, it may be a matter of ideology or principle, in
which case it may be either right or wrong that it should prevail. One cannot
generalise. However, in a real democracy, a minority will always have the right
to pursue the agreement of the majority, or, on a question of principle, to
eventually become the majority. It is only the reality of such a right that
makes membership of the whole tenable for the part. <p>

 The dictatorial rule over
minorities by majority groups within countries, and the rule over weak
majorities by powerful minorities, are the most pressing problems facing the
world today. Violent conflict is unfortunately still seen, in so many
countries, as the only means of resolving political problems. <p>

 The sense of past and present
injustice, the hope of freedom from tyranny, increased facility for
communication between dissident groups throughout the world, increased literacy
and education, the pressures of economic change, are all raising tensions which
require the dynamics of a new democracy to resolve, without the necessity or
excuse for resort to violence. <p>

 It is true that a minority must
defer to the will of the majority. That is the practical necessity imposed on
democracy by society's need for government to rule. But, for democracy to be
successful, the majority must always be willing to consider the real needs of
minorities. Otherwise government cannot be claimed to be FOR the people. Where
that does not happen a minority loses confidence in the system, and often with
some justification, resorts to a range of actions, from protest to naked
violence. And no matter how undesirable this may be, there is certain logic in
such a response that cannot be denied. Everywhere there are movements for
independence. <p>

 <B><CENTER>Democracy and Freedom</CENTER></B><p>

 If things that cannot be cured,
nor endured, can happen to us, then we are not free. We can only be free when
we are self-governing; i.e. when we have the same privilege of political input
to the decisions affecting us as anyone else. People are not free when they
must make a choice that is merely the least of two possible evils. A
least-worst choice has been equated with slavery. A least-worst choice is what
we have with the party system. <p>

<B><CENTER>Freedom</CENTER></B><p>

 The desire for freedom is a cry
for justice. Where justice reigns, there is no cry for freedom. But a serious
error is the rampant individualism which can destroys freedom. The other
fellow's 'freedom' can be dangerous. <p>

 'Pluralism' and
'multiculturalism' stand for the recognition, and even the support, of
individuality. So defined they are unquestionable rights - to be readily
granted. Individuality is creative; it adds colour to the life of our society.
But individualism, the improper assertion of selfish rights can, and often
does, ruin the rights and freedoms of others. Nor does self-assertion, at the
expense of the well being of others, lead to personal freedom. The genius, and
task, of a true democracy is to lead us to the necessary balance of well being
between all contesting interests. <p>

 Removal of anti-democratic
aspects of government is essential so that submission to <i>legitimate </i>authority
can lead to greater freedom - paradoxical! Strange but true! A society
controlled by law is a free society - when the lawmakers are 'owned' by the
people. <p>
 Freedom includes the need to
build individual 'potential', even economic potential. That is the background
to compulsory and assisted education. Escape from reality does not lead to
freedom. Life and freedom demand action, often costly action. Self-indulgence
and neglect lead to restraints, restricted opportunities, and straitened
circumstances. This is precisely the personal damage sustained by addiction to
drugs of every sort - including gluttony! The casualty is personal freedom. <p>
 Neglect may well lead to the
loss of freedom and the regrets and remorse for what might have been. But by
rejecting indulgence and shouldering our own burdens of responsibility we can
each help to produce the long-term benefits of a well-ordered society, and real
freedom. We can be part of the solution instead of the problem. <p>

 Because freedom needs real
democracy, we would do well to watch, and nip in the bud, any suggestion to
follow the presidential style of 'democracy', in which conflict with a
diminished parliament would be pervasive. We would do much better to design our
own style of government, if there is to be a change from the Monarchy. (See Chapter
8). <p>

 While we need leadership,
leaders (as distinct from leadership) are usually our problem as we have seen.
The door must not be left open for a leader to corner political power. For the
people to have too little control over a leader is a lapse of democracy, and
therefore a situation of acute danger. We, the people, must not let go of the
reins. Government by the people is our responsibility and must not be left in
jeopardy. The protection of democracy, in the end, depends on us. <p>

 <B><CENTER>Open Government</CENTER></B><p>

 The whole government process
should be open for all to see and hear. Only that way can confidence in the
political process be restored. Truth and justice can only flourish in the open.
Decisions should not be made behind closed doors. The public needs to be
assured that there is nothing beyond the public eye, affecting the decisions.
An open system of representation is essential. There is no room for the private
meeting with the Member of Parliament. All contact should be open, to public
knowledge, even public scrutiny. <p>

 <B><CENTER>An Ethical Society</CENTER></B><p>
 The Athenians believed that
their democracy was uplifting to their society through the opportunity that all
<i>voters</i> had to participate. (The exclusion of slaves is irrelevant to
this discussion). The evidence of the history of Western nations surely tends
to support this. If then, genuine democracy does help to build a better society
by expanding and uplifting the individual well-being, any improvements in the
democratic system, to make it more just, more worthy of the name of democracy,
and of the respect of the people, cannot be seen as optional. <p>

 <B><CENTER>An Exportable Democracy</CENTER></B><p>

 Since Victoria was the first to
adopt the secret ballot for the conduct of elections, should we supinely
respond to the challenge of necessary change to our political system with such
a weak question as, 'Is it done anywhere else?&#8217;. The world has a crying need
for an example of a real governmental system, which can operate with truth and
justice. But where can it look for an example to follow? <p>

 Since there are serious faults
in <i>our</i> democracy, political reform is a responsibility we should
shoulder, for our own benefit and ultimately, by the creation of an
'exportable' democracy, for the benefit of the world at large. It is up to us
to show the world a simple and good democracy, which will provoke them to
emulation. <p>

<B><CENTER> A Democratic Society</CENTER></B><p>

 Decision-making by individuals,
or groups, or whole communities is an important part of life. Our well being is
very much dependent on how we handle this. Our personal decisions must be in
harmony with our whole inner being. In making our decisions we can suppress our
true feelings only at our peril. Rather than resulting from failure to suppress
feeling, bad decisions stem from bad thinking. Good decisions depend on our
being open to all relevant facts, including the opinion of others (and the
wisdom of the ages). It is truth alone that can set us free to an enhanced
life. In our social or corporate life, repression or discouragement of truth -
always somewhere there, resident, in individual opinion - cannot occur without
harm to the whole. <p>

 (And this is true, right down to
the family forum - the family council. And we may wonder to what extent that is
practised in our communities. Many of us have failed in this area, with serious
hurt and regrettable consequences. Possibly the many homeless today are victims
of decisions which affected them seriously but to which their possible
reactions were neither considered nor sought.) <p>

 Within our communities, what
organisation is free of the kind of person who attains to a position in the
organisation, and proceeds to make decisions without reference to, or regard
for, the membership? There is probably no group in the community in which excessive
power is not wielded by some over others. Forcefulness in meetings cowers
opposition and precludes objective and logical debate. A non-executive director
of a large public company once remarked that balloting in the boardroom would
be a great idea. The implication was that the executive directors were
exercising an undue influence over the decisions of the company. Similarly, a
member of a cricket-umpiring association mentioned that, in a meeting of that
organisation, a request for a debate on an issue was promptly overruled by the
Chair, on the basis that the committee had already decided the matter!
Disagreement with leadership proposals and decisions is never popular with
leaders and their close followers. Dissidents will always experience some form
of pressure. Realistic discussion and debate are stifled. Disagreement often
causes offence. <p>

 Again, in how many churches
would the management committee, or equivalent body, be glad to submit their
decisions to a ballot of members? Decision-making in the various organisations
in our communities often generates heat, and less forceful people retreat into
silence and a dissatisfied acquiescence. They have then given up the right to
disagree; and eventually, to even think. The question arises, whether this is
really a democratic society at all. <p>

 While the ballot is the fairest
way to arrive at the decisions that an organisation must resolve, an extension
of its use from elections to ordinary decision-making is rare. Decisions
reached in meetings, without any chance of a ballot, are never truly
representative of the membership view. The ballot could defuse the undue power
of forceful people, diffuse emotional heat, and restore a highly desirable calm
to any contentious meeting. But since a ballot is usually not available there
is generally a meek raising of the hand in assent, or avoiding the meeting
altogether. Who of us has not done these things? We either put up with it and
grumble, or just 'vote with our feet'. A much greater use should be made of the
ballot. It should be the norm for the ballot to be frequently requested by
members in meeting, and agreed to by those presiding, without any demur
whatsoever. <p>
Many leaders have no time for
ballots, or any real desire to seek consensus. Even if, initially, their
motives are good, power will corrupt them. The best leaders can quickly become
the worst, because of their early and ready access to power. Once elected,
without the ballot for decisions, leaders can get 'the bit between their
teeth'. A firm control over the access to power is only available with the use
of the ballot for decisions as well as elections. There is a certain logic in
our habit of cutting down the 'tall poppies'. They can be a danger, although
the public is generally looking for 'good' leaders on whom they can rely. But
here is a problem. The fear of 'good' leaders getting too much power tends to
deny us the benefits of good leadership. Only when the public can make its
presence felt, with immediate effect, can that fear be allayed, and leadership
from any source be welcomed and effective. <p>

 Some years ago the use of the
ballot to control the up front people in a meeting was clearly demonstrated. In
a program on Hungarian television (under Communist control at the time, mind)
all participants had on their seats a secret ballot switch. The whole tenor of
the article in Time<sup>3</sup> magazine was that the meeting could not be
muzzled by the platform because of the continuous available of the ballot
facility to the meeting. A countrywoman routed a visiting official. She would
not sit down until the official had agreed to import black rubber boots!
Available boots, all red and yellow, did not suit. The black ones were soon
imported! <p>

 Just as the English barons cut
back the authority of the kings with Magna Carta, political parties grew up as
a defence against the rise of autocrats in a way that could not have been
available to the people generally. But in due course the barons gave way to the
popular franchise and faded from the scene. Or did they? Perhaps we still have
them, but in disguise! Belloc, were he still with us, would probably say that
they are the ones who still control our Parliaments - through the party system.<p>

 Kay Holt also, has correctly
noticed<sup>4</sup> ,
even government ministers. Too few have noticed the fallacy of local representation by party politicians and have left us in
bondage to the party system. Choosing party candidates you merely get what
parties can give, if they win!  We need the levelling effect that would result in parliament if MPs' votes
were all cast by secret ballot. All MPs would then be on the same level as
Independents - all effective representatives, and parliamentarians - and no
dictators! <p>

 Bob Hawke, speaking in the 1979  
Boyer Lectures ABC Series  on 'The Resolution of Conflict' went on to
say: <p>

 <UL>If the party system has reduced
the effectiveness of Parliament in its traditional role of the monitor of the
Executive, then good sense demands that we should ... seek methods to renew its
authority in the interests of the people. </UL><p>

 There are many critics of our
system of government but no serious attempts appear to have been made to remedy
the situation. Meanwhile we lumber on. We need a much more effective way, and a
greater capacity, to handle well the problems of the future. True 'democrats'
want everyone to have an equal say - just a 'fair go'. And that is not possible
in meetings where a ballot <i>cannot</i> be called - no matter in what social
or political context. The secret ballot is the democratic way to reach a decision
on any controversial question. It is the answer for every form of social
organisation, because it deals with the endemic problem of the abuse of power. <p>

 The degree of quiet acceptance
of the results of an election by ballot underline the value of this basic right
to share in the making of a decision, and it is up to us, ordinary folk, to
press for this practice to become widely accepted. As the Russian said,
&quot;democracy never comes from the 'Top'&quot;. It is up to all of us. <p>

 The Secret Ballot IN Parliament
is the missing element in our 'democracy'. And it is the absence of this
important feature that would ensure that party politics would immediately take
over parliament again, if (hypothetically) all the Members elected were
Independents. <p>

 It is plain that any worthwhile
revision of our political system will have to deal conclusively with the
problem of the access to power which the various parties, lobbies, and pressure
groups have. The procedure of voting by 'divisions' is archaic; and ridiculous.
The waste of time is one thing, but far worse is the openness of voting, which
supports the controls of the party system. The secret ballot must be used in
its place. Only this change will give all Members the freedom which will enable
them to vote by conscience on all decisions, and so demolish the control now
exercised by party leaders and Whips, and the power of the various interest
groups to exercise political pressure, by threatening the parties' election
hopes. <p>

 The parties' concentration on
power stultifies the whole process of debate, and prevents a cooperative
involvement in the formulation of sound policies, and the making of right
decisions. The real political power must become the prerogative of parliament
itself, instead of a coterie of party politicians manipulating parliament at
their own will and pleasure, for their own ends. No real progress to a genuine
and effective democracy can be achieved until this advance in parliamentary
practice is realised. <p>
 The Secret Ballot In Parliament
is the vital step which must be taken to: <p>

 <UL><LI>Change
the basis of the debate in the Parliament, and make Parliament a place where
the decisions are made; (no more debates with outcomes predetermined in party
rooms),  

 <LI>move towards television of a parliament
which is worth watching, reviving the real interest of the public, with
objective and purposeful debate replacing the lengthy formal speeches, and
putting an end to broadcast nonsense. Prime-time telecasts will then become
more and more vital viewing for an increasingly informed broadcast audience,  

 <LI>eliminate
personality politics. Under the proposed system such behaviour will be
profitless, will find no favour, and will cease. Only sound argument aimed at
swaying Members' votes in the ballot could win any respect and have any value,  

 <LI>achieve
a greater power and flexibility for the Parliament,  

 <LI>eliminate
the party tactics of attack, defence and cover-up, with new levels of openness
and honesty in government and the bureaucracy,
<LI> 
 have
the Parliament elect the most suitable Members as Ministers,  

 <LI>ensure
that all Members are accountable individually, and directly, to their
constituents by necessitating their immediate appeal to their electorates in
regular public meetings (this being the most effective and economical method of
commending themselves to their electorates in the new environment - meetings in
which each representative will, and must, urgently show worthiness as a
representative for reelection - meetings which will probably become mandatory,
by law,  thus
providing a forum in which critics, and concerned people generally, can be seen
and assessed as possible rival candidates at the next election, well before it
is due, and thus open up a new and effective avenue for persons of significant
ability to enter directly into an appropriate role in the parliament, without
delay, at the pleasure of the parliament as a whole,  

<LI>enable
attraction of the best people as candidates to the vital opportunities presented,  

 <LI>enhance
the status of politicians, by a vast improvement in the function and potential
of all Members, existing and to come,  
<LI>
 create
a strong parliament fit to govern in all eventualities. (It was amazing to
observe the weakness of the Speaker, and the President of the Senate, in the
debate over the Persian Gulf crisis when interruptions took place from the
public gallery.),
<LI>

 remove
the huge pressure and responsibility now resting on party leaders, and give
opportunity for all Members to undertake positive leadership on appropriate
issues,  
<LI>
 eliminate
the attraction of, and the need for, bigger and more expensive advertising
campaigns, based on parties, and (to an increasing extent) on party leaders,
<LI>

 enable
the excessive powers of single issue groups to be diffused, but give them new
opportunities to influence public opinion in local (non-party) meetings, which
will form a significant part of the decision-making process, reduce the
influence of big money, and the media in the dissemination of information, and
provide a new avenue for the growth of political understanding,  
<LI>

 enable
a majority to freely form on each matter on the basis of its objective merits.
With the ballot this will happen simply and quickly, whether the matter relates
to an issue, or an appointment to an office, have a truly democratic
parliament, flexible, decisive, and strong, yet fully accountable.
