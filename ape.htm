<p align="center"><font color="#FF00FF" face="Arial"><b>Voting in
Unions</b> </font></p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF" face="Arial">Much has been said about
the desirability of having secret ballots in unions for all
decisions which affect the public. Why not indeed? The reason is
not hard to see. Union leaderships have not wanted them either -
they would reduce their power.In many cases the leaders have
represented the views of the more aggressive members of the
union. But decisions, to 'stick' in the longer term, need to be
subject to the genuine agreement of the membership. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF" face="Arial">The claim is that secret
ballots are too long-winded because members would have to be
given a postal ballot to encompass the whole membership. But when
a decision is made in a meeting by a show of hands, there is no
concern about the views, or votes, of members not present. There
is no good reason why a ballot of members at a meeting should not
be held, for any decision affecting the public, or for decisions
concerning the members for that matter. If the attending members
are sufficient for a final decision by a show of hands, then they
most certainly are also sufficient for a decision by a secret
ballot in the meeting. In any case, this would more accurately
reflect the actual views of the members present, and many more
will attend when they know they have a minimum unimpeded input to
the meeting, through the use of the ballot. The new possibility
of fair decisions, by ballot, would also certainly encourage the
airing of dissenting views in the meeting. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF" face="Arial">The real challenge is for
government which can achieve all-round justice in the workplace,
and have the kind of public respect to enable it to successfully
deal with any<i> difficult </i>problems which may arise. Only
real democracy in our government system will enable real justice
to prevail, with reasonable consideration for all aspects of the
problems involved. Broad-brush decisions, made for 'political'
reasons, are not good enough. 'Politcs' in government and in
unions destroys justice. The left wing activist who said we want
leadership, not democracy, made the point clear. No right wing
politician could have said it better. Democracy requires serious
matters to be decided by the members not by 'leaders'. We need
the secret ballot in unions and in parliament. </font></p><P>
