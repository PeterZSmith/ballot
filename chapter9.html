<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU>A 'frontier' is a new opening, a new opportunity for a release of
creative energy and activity from the straitjacket of the exhausting and
exhausted status quo. The concept of real freedom is associated with the idea of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&#8216;frontier&#8217;; the possibility, the
challenge, and the soul stimulating freedom of breaking new ground. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU>We think of the early achievements of man, the invention of the
wheel, of written language, ancient civilisations, Athenian democracy, the
Renaissance, the steam engine, the internal combustion engine, the aeroplane,
the jet engine, the computer, the silicon chip and the PC; and now the
Internet! All these have been instrumental in transporting mankind into new
realms of power and potential to do things never done before, enabling the
fulfilment of man's creativity and spirit of adventure, into the unknown and
the untried. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU>Action is an essential component of life, which requires <i>real </i>freedom
- the freedom to do our thing; to follow our dream. So, what of the future?
Will we<i> </i>be free? Will we have the freedom to think, to express new and
life-changing thoughts, and convert them into action, in our various
environments? Will we be free to do our thing, to follow our dream? In our
personal lives faith sets us free. In home and family, love makes us free. In
our work environment the integrity of honest endeavour gives us freedom. And in
the wider community we have 'democracy'. If that does not set us free to lead
productive lives, with well being, then it is a fake; and we are lost. We may
suffer many setbacks through our own incapacity, through natural events, or
through bad health - that's life. But we cannot afford an avoidable degeneracy
of democracy, which hinders the legitimate freedom and creative potential of us
all, as individuals.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU>In many cases the help that more fortunate nations give to the less
fortunate ones is not the real answer to their problems. Internal order, with
justice, is the primary need so they can climb out of the murk by themselves.
But instead we see tragic turmoil throughout the world today, with enmity and
armed conflict between ethnic groups as the world fragments. Only real
democracy can achieve the good government they so much need, to stem the tide
of distrust and fear; and the suffering caused by war and starvation in so many
places. The world needs a model to follow, an example of a valid, viable
democracy free of the partisan taint which existing examples of 'democracy'
exhibit. The world suffers while it waits. Only with a steady reform of the
world&#8217;s democratic systems can there be real hope for the future. At the moment
it is simply the 'blind leading the blind'. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU>There is no reason why Australia cannot provide the example of a
breakthrough to a far more just and effective democracy. The secret ballot IN
parliament is the way to real democracy. A secret ballot parliament, radical in
concept, will far outshine any party system, be it a one, two, three or
multiparty system. It will open the door wide to a new quality of unifying
self-government, which can yield better justice, and better freedoms than any
bill of rights can confer. Serious problems will become tractable as a strongly
cooperating society produces the initiative, and the will, necessary for their
resolution. And this new style of democratic government will enable many new
frontiers to be opened, providing a wide range of new freedoms in all spheres
of human endeavour. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU>Under this system the reputation and standing of parliaments can be
enormously enhanced, bringing honour to any country, in addition to the good
community life, which only sound and just government can bring. For all
concerned people the opportunity to be part of the 'solution' will arrive with
Secret Ballots in Parliament. There will be an open opportunity for people in
any walk of life to initiate action with new ideas in respect of any of the
many issues that bedevil us. Anyone will have the same unfettered opportunity
to enter into an arena of substantive debate whenever they choose, within the
one new and comprehensive stream of non-partisan political activity and
self-government. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.2in'><span
lang=EN-AU>Those with no desire for real democracy may cry &quot;Chaos&quot;,
as their counterparts did in 1856, when the secret ballot for elections was
first adopted in Victoria. The reverse was true and it will be proved true
again. They should hold their fire, and realise that the good objectives they
(hopefully at present) seek will be much more effectively and securely achieved
under this new system of cooperative government. The secret ballot IN our
parliaments is the final step to real democracy. </span></p>
