<h1>Our Song of Democracy</h1><p>

<font SIZE="+1" FACE="arial" COLOR="Navy">You MPs and Senators leave us appalled,       <br>
With party-line voting whenever you're called,  <br>
You know very well it's the people you slight, <br>    
And we don't think you're all that engagin'; <br>
You can't have your way, hold the people at bay, <br>
For the times they are achangin'.......
<p>
You know that the world's in a terrible mess,  <br>
With widespread anxiety, unemployed stress,  <br>
With war and disease of a terrible kind, <br>
And  hopeless political turmoil;<br>
It's democracy's way - give the people <B>their</B> say, <br>
Then we'll all get along with this changin'......... 
<p>
You've hung up 'the system' with parties so long, <br>
You've forgotten completely democracy's song, <br>
That government rights to the people belong,<br>
And  the system needs much rearrangin';<br>
So get out of the way, it's the people's New Day, <br>
We're the ones who will soon do the changin'......
