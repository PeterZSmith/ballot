   <H2>  Comment & Reflection   </H2><p>
 <h3> Comment = 15/6/05</h3> <p>
 
 Someone once said that publishing a book of verse and waiting for the public's reaction, is like dropping a stone into the Grand Canyon and listening for the bang.<p>
I can vouch for the fact that broaching the subject of serious reform of our ailing democracy is just the same. The eyes glaze over! 
I remember only one (scathing) comment on Margo Kingston's Webdiary - 'Poppycock (how very <I>senior</I>),  to my  proposal for ballots in parliament instead of 'divisions'. (I was also rebuked for mentioning my party website.) <p>
 
Clearly the status quo has everyone firmly in its grip. Until the dam of frustration bursts, it seems that real reform is never achieved, When the people are really desperate, as in the American War of Independence, The French Bastille, and our own Eureka Stockade, at last the people get, by violent action, the reforms  that they could not otherwise achieve.<p>
For democracy to advance we have the two alternatives of serious intelligent response to proffered solutions, or revolution.<p>

Clearly we are not lacking in intelligent participants, and many good points are often raised,  but why are we so fearful of dealing with the root of the problem? People who clearly can think, usually do not. I quote the sarcastic comment of Barry Jones (of no mean intellect) on one occasion years ago, to the proposal of non-partisan democracy, via secret ballots prevailing in our parliaments:
'Next you'll want secret debate, I suppose!'<p>
Well, actually, that's  what we have now - in the ruling party room, where the actual decisions are made; public debate, in parliament, being s mere charade.<p>
Every country has had to find its own solutions to its own political structural problems and we must do the same. But the goal of complete democracy can never be fully realized, It is a an ongoing response to changing circumstances,and will never be easy'.  
 There is now substantial concern about the possibility of a growing conflict between the old and the young, in the political tussle to share the GDP equitably. It is only one of many problems.<p>
I submit the only real, and practical, answer to our political dilemma lies in eradicating party power from our political system by the rule of the secret ballot to settle all decisions in parliament. <p>
We must remember that the problems are set to become larger, not smaller, as time goes by.<p>
  
  
 <h3> Leave God out of it. -
 Comment - 23/5/05  </h3> <p>
Yes - Pamela Bone, writing in the 'Age' (Melbourne) today, is quite right - and wrong. <p>
Right in claiming that ethical values are intrinsic to our human nature, and wrong in dismissing the relevance of the 'power' that formed us.<p>
But for a politician to claim religious authority for a personal view as a Christian is to use an authority that is political, not Christian.<BR><BR>
Here is the nub of the problem.<p>
In our corrupted democracy we have ceded so much power to party politicians that it is easy for them to become 'a law unto themselves'. <p>
 The path to less power for politicians (and more ethics), needs a restoration of the   authority of parliament, vis-a-vis the executive, with conscience voting of members prevailing via secret voting in parliament.<p>
Then, individual and minority views, political, religious or otherwise, will not have the present power to unduly influence or worry us.<p>


    <h3> Comment -19.5.05  </h3> <p>
  Are we ever likely to have governments hand over their stranglehold on public affairs with a statutory bill of rights of any kind, or offer to open up the possibility of constitutional change by referendum?<br>
 No way.<br>
There are many  who are unhappy about the hold over us that elected, but dictatorial government has, but we  need to rally around to attack the root cause of the problem.<br>
 There is one cause that is common to every gripe we see and hear in the public arena - the power of  'democratic' government to ignore the people. Let's face it, democracy is a process of the people looking for  better answers, not an accomplished goal, despite the rhetoric of the powerful.  <br>
Some have said that we need more independents, even a parliament of independents. <br>
The view is that without such locally responsible representatives there can never be adequate involvement of the public, or representative accountability.<br>
Some have said that many independents would form parties again. <br>  
Again, some have said you can't have coherent government with a parliament of independents. <br>
 But there is one move which could resolve those objections in one fell swoop -  a public demand for all debates and appointment of ministers in parliament to be decided by secret ballot<br>
The secret ballot would make all members independent, giving them equal power in parliament, but propelling them back to local policy involvement and responsibility.<br>
Furthermore, ministers appointed by parliament would immediately become answerable to parliament for their individual and team performance. <br><br>

 <h5> Party politics - the enemy of democracy. </h5><BR><p>
 <h3> Comment -16.5.05 </h3> 
<br>In his 1942 book 'The Forgotten People -  Chap.33 'The nature of Democracy', Menzies says:  
  'Government of the people by my party, for me, is not democracy. It is just a system of crooked bargaining. It cannot support any decent new order, and it is not worth fighting for.' 
<br><br>
Democracy is not just a political system to which the whole world should aspire. It is an attitude.  One which respects the rights of others, refusing unfair advantage, and embracing the golden rules of 'Love your neighbour' and 'Do unto others as you would that they should do unto you.'<br><br>
 
The heart of democracy is therefore the secret ballot. Where  it is excluded, democracy suffocates, with frustration, emotion and conflict - or, just apathy. The ballot subtracts excessive power from the powerful. Where it is the rule, fairness prevails - and calm.    <p>

 
 <h3> Comment -  23/2/05.</h3> <p>
Today we are informed that four hundred and fifty  more Australian troops will go to Iraq on combat duty, to protect Japanese reconstruction workers.  <br>
So far it seems no one has connected this government's foolhardy, and promise-breaking move with the history of the Vietnam war.<P>
18/2/05.<br>
When an Iranian nuclear physicist has been intent on circulating nuclear expertise to other
Islamic states, with the motive of making Islam great, then we can know that serious
confrontation with the West (read Judeo/Christian countries) is on the rise.<BR>
It is obvious that little common ground exists between Islam and Israel, and  the West's neglect
of the Palestinians' problems firmly positions America, and its coalition allies, at risk of
'terrorist' action.
<br><br>
With threatening attitudes the US has triggered fear and aggressive attitudes and responses
from a number of states on the subject of nuclear proliferation. Continually, and justifiably,
 in view of its aggressive stance, fearful of attacks on its soil and interests, it is also
  extremely vulnerable, despite its massive military capability.<br><br>
  While being polite to (loving?) its enemies might fit well with its avowed
  religious convictions, there is little sign of the lateral thinking that might reverse the
  worrying dependence on desperate threat and military expenditure to resolve the growing
  tensions. <br><br>
   The way back to peace and sanity is daily becoming  longer. <p>
 <h3> Comment -  16/2/05.</h3>  <p>
 It troubles me considerably that our politics consists of so much
 squabbling, so much evasion, so much jostling for advantage, when we are the proud country of
 the fair go, and when our practice of the secret ballot for elections so clearly indicates its
 unique power to achieve just ends in the calmest way.<br><br>
 Since parliament is where decisions must be made, why not give our representatives the assurance
 of the secret ballot to enable them to make their decisions objectively, secure from outside
 pressure, in a calm and sane manner. <br><br>
   
   <h3> Comment -  4/1/05.</h3> 
   
   The Tsunami disaster has stunned the world with its countless casualties. And who knows how many more, with inadequate resources to treat the injured, threatening diseases and starvation? As efforts to deal with this international crisis escalate we see how normal is the compassionate response of ordinary people and also of governments.<br>
Theology seems to be getting a thrashing as the diverse religious views attempt to explain the way we should see this tragedy. Is God to blame they ask? Is He all powerful? over nature? or in the affairs of men?  Clearly not, in either case.<br><br>
 Our physical world is governed by physical laws, not by a giant intelligence controlling everything from the sky.<br>
  Living things have spirits. Living things are not automatons - all have freewill from the creator, responding to situations as they will. Go near a bull-ants nest and see.  <br><br>
God inhabits His universe - the Spirit of Life. Jesus commented that even a sparrow cannot fall to the earth <I>without God</I> - not as people often say:'without God <i>knowing'</i>.<br><br>
A hurt infant will cry out for the love of the parent, and a drowning person will cry for God - the Creator. God is not absent in the sky. His Spirit is everywhere, all about us, as well as in us. The Bible records Paul's reminder to the Athenian philosophers (of what they already knew): 'In Him we live and move and have our being'.<br><br>
God cannot directly control man - who has freewill and can makes mistakes, and do terrible things.<br>
So we see that there is no master mind in the sky, responsible for the acts of nature (nor the mischief of Man). <br>
But the Bible tells us that God is love. There is an obvious corollary. God is not a distant complacent, careless being in the sky. God loves, so He suffers, interminably - but that love is unquenchable by death. That is the real message of the Cross. Suffering is the inevitable consequence of living on a dangerous planet (boiling not too far below us), amid the dangers of a less than perfect mankind. But perfect love overcomes the fear of death.  <br><br>
In the film 'Thursdays with Morrie' a self centered-ex-student, after many years, eventually calls his favourite teacher who is dying. At length the ex student gets the life-changing message. Until you know how to handle death you cannot really know how to live.<br>
It is the message of the Cross which inspires the faith and the love that is selfless - empowering life in a troubled world.<br>
The story is told of Lord Shaftesbury (an eighteenth-century Christian) who, while visiting slums in England with a clergyman, was confronted by starving people. His companion said exasperatedly: 'Why doesn't God do something?' 'He <I>is</I>' said Shaftesbury, and immediately hurried off to organise relief measures.<br><br>
Theologians, and others, who seem to be puzzled at this time, may well heed and be reassured by the compassion of ordinary people queuing so promptly to give. <br><br>

 
  <h3> Comment -  2/11/04. - The US Election  </h3>  
 
 
 <br>Today is the day when the result of the election, which no one can call, will be decided by the decrepit US voting system<br><br>
The US system appears to be a shambles, with voters queuing for hours to vote, and with much doubt about the accuracy of the subsequent counting.<br><br>
At least Australia has a competent, reliable and orderly electoral system, with its compulsory involvement in the ballot. <P>
With the US election sullied beyond measure by partisan enmity and dirty tricks, apparently found necessary in the pursuit of power, what respect can the world have for the 'democracy' which the US boasts so constantly about.  <br><br>

In this age of such superior advance in many fields why are they still struggling to advance  their electoral process beyond the horse and buggy days? Because they still believe  in leadership power, with its accompanying strong emotions of pride and fear, not by the deeper values of democracy - truth, and mutual respect.<br><br>
  
<h3>    The Australian election - October 9 - A matter of trust! </h3> <p>
           
  How does this battle between two leaders line up with the original concept of democracy --- which means power to the people. Two leaders battling for the power to make war or anything else they want to do with little, if any, reference to the parliament, let alone the people. <br><br>
Only the reorganization of parliament under the control of the whole house, with the essential tool of the secret ballot, can reintroduce democracy to this country. <BR><BR>It's time for this revolutionary change, before our system of government is further sunk in the mire of autocracy. <p>
   
 <h3> Islamic 'terrorism' - As I see it.  </h3> <p>

George Bush has done nothing to heal the fifty years of Israeli scarifying the Palestinians out of their own land - just as if they were weeds.<br><br>
Can anyone doubt that the wave of 'terrorism' by Palestinians, al Qaeda, or any others is   a direct result of this criminal neglect.   <br><br>
Remove the primary cause and then the further problems will become tractable.<br><br>
The West has preyed upon the Middle east for two generations, bleeding it dry, just the same as the colonial powers have done throughout the whole world. <br><br> 

Terrorists see themselves as at war. What's more they see it as a holy war, endorsed by God. Who knows? <br>
Even Nebuchadnezzar, when attacking Jerusalem, was called by God (according to the the Scriptures) "My servant". 
God, 'gave' Palestine to Abraham and his descendants, but it is plain from the Scriptures that the promise was conditional on Abraham-like faith (or character)which is plainly what the prophet Micah (6:8) says:<br>
'He has showed you O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?' Similarly, the prophet Jeremiah, C22:3-5. Who then are the real descendants of Abraham?<br><br>
 
 With Western sympathy, many refugees from the holocaust settled in Palestine. But the pursuit of an Israeli state, the Zionist dream, propelled the immigration, resulting in the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into refugee camps in Lebanon, the West Bank of Jordan and the Gaza Strip.<br><br>
The Palestinians sought recognition of a separate state and their own government. This had been long agreed by the UN but permanently stalled by Israeli governments, heavily supported, financially and militarily, by the US, by reason of the political clout of the American Jewish lobby with the agreement of the Christian Right. The Christian Right are making a serious mistake. They should note the words of Jesus, especially His attitude to the temple, and prophecy of its destruction. In due time the Romans rased it to the ground after successive rebellions and the inhabitants fled the country. Now after two millennia they believe they can have it all back. The world does not agree and the UN designed a partitioned land as the best option. Extreme opinion on both sides have rejected that solution, and having the power to do so have been intent on preventing its happening.<br><br>
The power of the extremist Palestinians and Arab friends (politically and militarily  to weak for warfare) lies in the passionate sense of injustice combined with the suicide bombers' Islamic conviction of a wonderful hereafter. <br><br>
In Israel, the majority who want peace are thwarted by the climate of fear  (engendered by the failure of the UN initiatives) which enables the right wing minority, with the moral, financial and military support of American right-wing (religious-influenced) government, to pursue the demise of the Palestinian dream of a separate state. The government-assisted establishment of  numerous Jewish strategic settlements throughout Palestinian territory is spelling the end of a separate state for the Palestinians, they being despised and gradually enslaved in their own remaining . <br><br>
< 
Added to the general view of Islam that America is a godless, immoral nation, with its powerful interference in the economy and politics of many countries, the Palestinian injustice has proved the last straw, and the notion of Jihad has taken hold. <br><br> 
Here we have an evil situation, the product of  two religious misconceptions:<br><br>
1. The Zionists fail to recognize that the promise that Abraham understood God to make to him and his progeny concerning the inheritance of the whole of Palestine, was conditional, stemming from  Abraham's character, as exemplified by the moral stipulation in the prophet Micah (C.6:8): 'He has showed you O man what is good; and what does the LORD require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God', and <br><br>

2. The Islamic myth: that the Jihad suicides will enjoy fantastic 
    honour and physical pleasures in an after life - even for the murder of the innocent.<br><br>
Only the '... meek shall inherit the earth.'(Matt.5:5)<br><br>

One might well wonder what might be the solution. It is clear however that the UN must find it.  America's involvement is too complex for it to be trusted. Furthermore American involvement in support of Israel is widely perceived to aggravate, even possibly is, the problem. Additionally American abstinence from the full support of the UN has substantially weakened, and hindered a solution by the UN.<br><br>
While minorities rule, democracy languishes and satisfactory progress is denied us. It's the same the world over. When will we wake up. <br><br>
 The Palestine issue is far harder to resolve than military attacks on  the   'axis of evil'.  This matter is important and urgently needs reasoned debate - with goodwill.</b> <br><br>
 
It is a firm principle that, where there are problems  to be faced, the best way is to tackle the hardest first.
