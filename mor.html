<DIV class=content>
<H3>Danger ahead. </H3>We are living on borrowed time -<BR>involved in an 
unpopular, divisive war based on fear of a hidden enemy of unknown capacity to 
harm us.<BR>But what is known, is that Islamic spokesmen often claim that Islam is fundamentally opposed to 
our tradition of democracy. Some call for the re-establishment of the 
Islamic Caliphate, from Indonesia to Spain - and Australia?.<BR>Moderate Islam may not be opposed 
to democracy but, its response to a call for moderate leaders to condemn 
violence is not encouraging. There is confusion in the ranks, due to the growing 
radicalism in Islam, and  its young may have made up their minds beyond recall.</BR>
  This resurgence of fundamentalism in Islam shows a real possibility of 
prevailing over more moderate views.<BR>The war in Iraq, aimed at forming 
democracy by force has been a failure. So Iraq does not present as a step toward democracy, which has, rather suffered a setback that we do not need. We may be now at an early stage in a long and 
bitter conflict, evidenced by the determined use of suicide bombs, in Iraq, and 
around the world.<BR><BR>So where do we stand?<BR><BR>We will need all the 
wisdom and moral/political strength we can muster to resolve the conflict, for which we in 'the West' must accept some responsibility. </BR>The 
seeds of religious conflict have been dormant for years, decades, even 
centuries, but the fruit is at last appearing inexorably.<BR>In the face of 
these pressures we must stand very firm for democracy. It cannot be negotiable. 
It is the only way. The democratic will of the people must take precedence over 
any religion - be it Christian, Muslim of any other. </BR>We must 'Render unto Caesar those 
things that are Caesar's, and unto God those things that are God's' - (Jesus).<BR><BR>It 
folows that any religious concerns diverse from the views of the people at large 
must not succeed except by a process of public persuasion - never by intimidation or 
manipulation.<BR><BR>But here we have a problem. Islam does not respect 
'democracy', for that matter, neither do we, as currently (mis-)practiced. 
Political manipulation and exclusion of the people from effective participation 
is rife in our corrupted democracy, so much so that it lacks the moral dimension 
and strength to meet the challenges we now face. This has to change - 
radically.<BR><BR>
<H5>Is our 'democracy' ready for the Future? Of course not.</H5><BR>Party 
politics has destroyed democracy, and us as legitimate participants. </BR>
It is hard work for those concerned, but most of their efforts are wasted in the conflict they foster. <BR>
Real democracy  resolves conflict, creates harmony, and unifies a country to face 
the many serious problems looming ahead. The high and rising petrol prices are 
likely to be the least of our worries, unless we can develop a system of 
government which creates a partnership with the people. <BR>The secret ballot 
has been the making of democracy in our elections, but we need it in our 
parliaments to complete the cycle of democratic government. The practical 
exclusion of the people from the decision-making process has produced party 
government - a sterile democracy. <BR><BR>We need to be serious about democratic 
reform not just complain about politicians. And with modern technology, serious 
and far-reaching change is possible as never before. <BR><BR>The Secret Ballot 
Party's objective is to install secret voting in parliament to decide all 
debates, and ministry appointments, and send the traitorous practice of 
party-line voting to perdition - where it belongs. <BR><BR>Many are crying for 
change but it appears to escape public consciousness how completely 
<EM><STRONG>decisive and fair</STRONG></EM> the secret ballot is in elections. 
It would be equally so in parliament, and will achieve the radical changes we 
need, for a fair society, in a very short time, opening up endless beneficial 
possibilities for the future - not to mention a new and confident relationship 
between government and people. <BR><BR>The secret ballot is the tool which gives 
life to democracy wherever it is employed.<BR><BR>
<SPAN class=readthisifnothingelse>The secret ballot for all decisions in our 
parliaments is the secret which alone can undo the damage wrought by the party 
system, and recreate our democracy with individual independence and 
responsibility. </SPAN><BR><BR>
<H3>The Way Forward</H3>How can such a revolutionary change be pursued?<BR>This 
'party' is a rallying point for all who want a much better democracy. <BR>This 
party will: 
<UL>
  <LI> not itself have a preoccupation with issues. 
  <LI>initially, have a free membership. 
  <LI>endorse candidates committed to the secret ballot in parliament. 
  <LI>give complete freedom of candidates to act as agreed with their 
  electorates on all issues. 
  <LI>be able to have more than one candidate in a seat. </LI></UL>The party's 
success will automatically ensure its demise. <BR><BR>A 
<EM><STRONG>real</EM></STRONG> democracy will result in: <BR><BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Abolition of party power in parliaments. 
  <LI>Restoration of <EM>parliamentary</EM> authority. 
  <LI>Subjection of the executive to parliament. 
  <LI>Removal of lobby power from parliament. 
  <LI>Restoration of public involvement. 
  <LI>Restoration of representative accountability. </LI></UL>
<H3>Electoral Meetings</H3>A major gap in our Australian democracy is the 
absence of 'the local town meeting', in which a representative can become well 
known and trusted, enabling effective community input, and a growing confidence 
of the people in their representative - an essential factor which has been too 
long missing from our 'representative self-government'. <BR><BR>Despite the 
rhetoric about our modern 'democracy' the Athenians would not have had a bar of 
it. Democracy is their invention. Pericles said: 'We call it a democracy 
because, unlike our neighbours, decisions are made by the many rather than the 
few'.<BR><BR>'Elected dictatorship' is not for us. </DIV>
